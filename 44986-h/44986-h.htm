<h2 title="Preface"><a id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p>In venturing to add another book on Qualitative Chemical
Analysis to the long list of publications on this subject, the author
has been moved chiefly by the often expressed wish of students
and friends to have his lectures on qualitative analysis rendered
available for reference and for a wider circle of instruction.
Parts I and II of the present book embody these lectures in the
form to which they have developed in the course of the last sixteen
years, since, in 1894, the teaching of analytical chemistry,
along the lines followed, was first suggested by Ostwald's pioneer
"Wissenschaftliche Grundlagen der Analytischen Chemie."</p>

<p>The author believes that instruction in qualitative analysis,
besides teaching analysis proper, should demand of the student
a very distinct advance in the study of general chemistry, and
should also, consciously, pave the way for work in quantitative
analysis, if it is not, indeed, accompanied by work in that subject.
The professional method of work, whether routine or research
work of the academic or the industrial laboratory is involved,
inevitably consists in first making an exhaustive study of the
<em class="italic">general chemical</em> aspects of the subject under examination: it
includes a thorough study of books of reference and of the original
literature on the subject; and when the experimental work is
finally undertaken, it is carried out with a critical, searching
mind, which questions every observation made, every process
used. The method of instruction in this book aims at developing
these habits of the professional, productive chemist. For
the reasons given, a rather thorough and somewhat critical study
is first made (in Part I) of the fundamental general chemical
principles which are most widely involved in analytical work.
The applications of these principles to the subject matter of
elementary qualitative analysis are then discussed (in Part II),
in closest connection with the laboratory work covering the study
of analytical reactions (in Part III). The material is presented,
not as a finished subject, but as a growing one, with which the
present generation of chemists is still busy, and which contains
many important, unsolved problems of a fundamental character.
Numerous references to standard works and to the current literature
are given, of which those suitable for reading by the young
student are specially designated. The obvious demand is thereby
made on the student to aim to remain in touch with the growth
of the science, after he has completed his studies under the guidance
of an instructor. Finally, to arouse and develop the critical,
questioning attitude of the professional chemist, referred to above,
the subject matter of the laboratory work, given in Part III,
is put very largely in the form of questions, which demand not
only careful observation on the part of the student, but also a
thoughtful interpretation of the observations made.</p>

<p>In the experience of the author, although the majority of
students attending his lectures had already acquired some knowledge
of chemical and physical equilibrium, of the theories of
solutions and of ionization and of their applications, the more exhaustive
treatment of parts of these subjects and of related topics,
to which a course in qualitative analysis lends itself, has been of particular
benefit to them, bringing them into closer touch with the
method of detailed study of a chemical topic, than the broader,
more varied work of general chemistry courses usually does.
Throughout the theoretical treatment of the subject, the attempt
is made to prepare the student for a more general <em class="italic">quantitative</em>
expression of chemical relations. For this reason, chemical and
physical equilibrium constants are given and used, wherever it
is possible. The author is aware that these "constants" have,
in part, only a temporary standing; that more exact work will
continually modify their numerical values and, probably, limit
the field for their <em class="italic">rigorous</em> application. The latter facts can be
impressed on the student and still the invaluable principle be
inculcated in his mind, that chemistry is striving to express its
relations, as far as possible, in mathematical terms, exactly as
its sister science, physics, has long been doing. At the same
time the treatment of physicochemical topics has been kept
within the bounds set by the subject matter, and by the chemical
maturity of the students addressed: it is elementary in form, and
quantitative relations are used, in the main, only to elucidate
qualitative facts. The rigorous development of the subjects
presented and their elaboration from a purely physicochemical
standpoint are left to advanced courses. It has been found that
this method interests the better class of students in seeking such
advanced courses.</p>

<p>The relations of qualitative to quantitative analysis are touched
upon in the theoretical treatment, where it has been feasible to do
so. The laboratory methods aim also at beginning the training
of students in the habit of accuracy demanded by quantitative
analysis, by laying special emphasis on the methods of detecting
traces of a number of the common elements and by requiring a
report on the relative quantities of components found. The study
of reactions is carried out, almost wholly, with solutions of known
and uniform molar concentration. However, the actual development
of quantitative accuracy is left to the instruction in the
courses in quantitative analysis, in which a successful training in
this direction is far more readily attained. Simultaneous courses
in the two branches of analysis seem to the author to be highly
desirable, whenever practicable. The study of quantitative analysis
adds neatness of manipulation and accuracy to the work in
qualitative analysis; and the latter supplies the opportunity for
the further development of a student's knowledge of general
chemistry, for which there is a much smaller scope in quantitative
analysis courses, and thus relieves a condition where a serious
pedagogical defect is likely to exist in the development of our
students.</p>

<p>Parts III and IV of this book are published in a separate volume,
as a laboratory manual for qualitative analysis. They comprise
the instructions for laboratory work introductory to systematic
analysis (the study of reactions and of the analysis of groups,
in Part III) and an outline for elementary systematic analysis
(Part IV). The attempt has been made, in particular, to bring
the laboratory work, which otherwise follows the usual lines of
instruction in systematic analysis, <em class="italic">also into closest relations to the
development of the scientific foundations of analytical chemistry</em>, as
represented in Parts I and II. It is believed that the subject
matter lends itself especially well to such a close interweaving
of the two sides of the study, without any special loss of time to
the student, and with the result, it is hoped, of a greatly increased
interest on his part and an increased stimulus of the habit of
scientific thought.</p>

<p>The following plan of work is used by the author with his
classes: The first section (lasting eleven weeks) of the course in
qualitative analysis is started with some seven to ten (according
to the ability of the class) lectures or classroom exercises, given
daily, and covering the first seven or the eight chapters of Part I.
At the end of the second week the laboratory work is started.
During the remainder of this section of the course, two hours
of classroom work and eight hours of laboratory work per week
are required, and, in this period, Part III, comprising the first
half of the laboratory manual, is studied in the laboratory in
closest connection with the classroom work on Part II of the book.
As far as possible, the laboratory work on a given topic
<em class="italic">precedes</em>
the classroom work. This first course is followed by an eleven
weeks' course in systematic analysis, covering Part IV of the book.
A third (graduate) course, optional for students specializing in
chemistry, is offered, in which very complex commercial and
natural products are analyzed and in which special attention is
also given to rare elements. During this course, particular care
is taken to familiarize students with other works on qualitative
analysis, such as the outlines of A. A. Noyes and Bray, and the
special parts of Fresenius's manual.</p>

<p>Students who have been prepared in general chemistry along
physicochemical lines, as represented, for instance, by Smith's
textbooks, make more rapid and more easy progress in the first
course than do students otherwise prepared. But the treatment
of the subject is intended to make it possible for students, who
have not paid particular attention to chemical equilibrium and to
the modern theories of solution in their general chemistry course,
to complete the course within the time limit indicated. Perhaps
one-third of the students in an average class, in the past, have
taken the course under these conditions and no special difficulty
was encountered by them.</p>

<p>In the theoretical treatment the author is particularly indebted
to the original articles and to the larger works of Arrhenius,
van&#160;'t Hoff, Nernst, A. A. Noyes, Ostwald, and Walker. For the
systematic analytical material acknowledgment is due, in particular,
to Fresenius's "Qualitative Chemical Analysis," and to the
important publications by A. A. Noyes and Bray in the <em class="italic">Journal
of the American Chemical Society</em>. Some of the excellent methods
of the latter authors have been adopted outright, as indicated in
the text. For some special matters the author is indebted to the
texts of W. A. Noyes and of Böttger. Constant references to
his sources of information have been made by the author, partly
as a matter of acknowledgment, and more particularly to give
students and teachers the opportunity for more extended, first-hand
reading on any topic of interest. References suitable for
college students are indicated by the addition of (<em class="bold">Stud.</em>). In two
or three instances, the original source of information has been
forgotten and diligent search has failed to trace it. For use in
preparing any future edition of the book, the author will be glad
to have his attention called to the facts by authors.</p>

<p>The author wishes to express here his particular appreciation
of the generous assistance given him by his former colleague,
Prof. Alexander Smith of Columbia University, whose suggestions
and advice, especially in the editing of the manuscript and proof,
have been invaluable. He also wishes to make grateful acknowledgment
to his colleagues, Profs. H. N. McCoy, H. Schlesinger,
and Dr. Edith Barnard, to Prof. L. W. Jones of the University
of Cincinnati, Prof. E. P. Schoch of the University of Texas,
Prof. B. B. Freud of Armour Institute, and Prof. W. J. Hale of
the University of Michigan, who have assisted him by reading the
proofs or the manuscript, or by carrying out experimental studies
underlying part of the work, or in other ways. Corrections of
his mistakes of omission and commission, and suggestions, will be
gratefully received by the author.</p>

INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>Qualitative chemical analysis is concerned with the determination
of the kinds of matter present in any given substance.
In its broadest sense it includes the determination of all kinds
of matter, the elements, rare as well as common, and all their
combinations, organic compounds as well as inorganic. The
recognition of the presence of rare elements, such as radium,
uranium, thorium, tungsten, cerium, etc., is becoming a matter
of growing importance with the modern development of the
subject of radioactivity and the technical exploitation of the rarer
elements, and it is a common experience for an analytical chemist
to be called upon to determine the presence or absence of alcohol
in beverages, of formalin in milk or other foods, and not a rare
experience to be obliged to make tests for the presence of alkaloids
like strychnine, morphine, cocaine, or for the presence of numerous
other organic compounds. In this book, however, we shall limit
our material to the more common elements and their most important
inorganic combinations, including only a few typical
organic acids. The limitation of our experimental material will
make it possible to devote special attention to the scientific
principles underlying analysis, to secure a clear and definite grasp
of them, and to impart with simple material such experience in the
technique and methods of analysis as will train the student to
apply both his theoretical and practical knowledge to any field
of analysis occasion may require. Accurate qualitative analysis,
<a id="p004" class="xxpn">[p004]</a> in any field, will depend on the care taken in mastering the theoretical
significance and the technique of the methods recommended
for the specific problem before the analyst; the details of the
methods themselves, in any problem involving more than elementary
analysis, are sought and found by him as a matter of practice
in suitable larger works, in monographs and in the original literature.
With the object of suggesting this broader application of
the training acquired and of cultivating the invaluable habit of
the professional chemist of consulting larger works and the literature,
frequent reference will be made to such larger works, and
to original papers in which more special subjects of analysis or
theory are elaborately treated.</p>

<p>To recognize, in a substance, the presence of any element or
compound, one must know its characteristic reactions, which
will make it possible to distinguish it from all other elements or
compounds. Further, in order to reach conclusions with the
greatest possible speed, directness, and conclusiveness, it is usually
best to carry out an examination in some systematic way, rather
than in a haphazard and irregular fashion. We distinguish,
accordingly, two parts in our laboratory work: first, the study
of characteristic tests or <em class="italic">reactions</em> of the common elements and
such of their compounds as are of importance in elementary
analysis (Part III), and, secondly, practice in a <em class="italic">systematic</em> method
of analysis (Part IV). In the study of the reactions, the way will
be paved for systematic analysis, by taking the elements in the
groups, which form the basis of the system of analysis employed,
and by analyses of mixtures of the elements of a group immediately
after the group has been studied.</p>

<p>Reliable and intelligent analysis is possible only with a clear
knowledge of the chemistry of the reactions used, and the chemistry
of the most important typical reactions will therefore be
considered (in Part II), simultaneously with the laboratory study
of the reactions and of systematic analysis.</p>

<p>The reactions for identifying an element or compound must
bring physical evidence which can be recognized by our senses.
The sense of <em class="italic">touch</em> is scarcely ever appealed to; perhaps the
numbness or paralysis of the sense of touch imparted to the
tongue or eyelid by the alkaloid cocaine and a few modern substitutes
for it, and the tingling sensation produced on the tongue
<a id="p005" class="xxpn">[p005]</a> by aconite and its preparations, are the most important, but rare,
instances of an appeal to this sense in analytical work. The sense
of <em class="italic">taste</em> is also rarely used, and always with the greatest care to
prevent poisonous effects. Acids and bases, bitter alkaloids, such
as strychnine and brucine, sweet substances, such as cane sugar,
glucose, glycerine, are instances of compounds which affect our
sense of taste. In all these cases the taste is used rather as a confirmative
test than as a conclusive proof of the identity of a suspected
substance.</p>

<p>The sense of <em class="italic">smell</em> is rather more useful in qualitative analysis
than that of taste or of touch. Hydrogen sulphide and ammonia,
unless present in traces only, readily reveal themselves by their
odor. Every chemist should be familiar with the faint but very
characteristic odor of hydrocyanic
acid,<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>
which should instantly
and automatically warn him of the presence of this potent poison.
Owing to partial decomposition by the moisture and carbonic
acid absorbed from the atmosphere, alkali cyanides also give this
important warning signal. Tests based on the odors of compounds
are particularly valuable in the field of organic chemistry, where
the sense of smell is extensively used for qualitative purposes;
for instance, the pleasant smell of acetic ester, and the nauseating
odor of an organic arsenic derivative, cacodyl oxide, may be used
with advantage in identifying acetic acid.</p>

<p>But the evidence of touch, taste, and smell is, on the whole,
only occasionally available in chemical analysis—almost all the
tests employed are <em class="italic">visual</em> ones. A small proportion of these are
<em class="italic">color</em> tests. The color of iodine vapor or of the solution of iodine
in chloroform, the colors of metallic copper or gold, of copper
salts in ammoniacal solutions, of sulphides, such as the orange
sulphide of antimony (<em class="italic">exps.</em>), may be mentioned as instances,
in which a test of identity depends on the observation of some
characteristic color. But the great majority of analytical tests
depend on <em class="italic">observations of changes of state</em>; evidence consisting
in the solution of solids, the formation of precipitates, the evolution
of gases, forms the most important part of the observations,
<a id="p006" class="xxpn">[p006]</a> on which our conclusions are based. In organic chemistry, determinations
of melting-points and of boiling-points, which are very
commonly used for the qualitative identification of compounds,
form further instances of the application, to qualitative purposes,
of observations based on changes of state.</p>

<p>In very many cases, where the formation or nonformation of
a precipitate is intended to be used as an indication of the presence
or absence of a given substance, the precipitating agent may throw
down one or more of several different precipitates, which, seen
without the aid of a microscope, cannot be identified without
further examination. It is, thus, commonly necessary to use a
sequence of such tests for the complete identification. For
instance, the addition of hydrochloric acid to a solution of lead,
mercurous or silver nitrate will produce a white precipitate.
The precipitates may be distinguished by a further examination
of their solubilities: hot water will dissolve the lead chloride,
ammonia readily dissolves the chloride of silver and converts the
mercurous chloride into a black insoluble mixture containing finely
divided mercury (<em class="italic">exps.</em>). By the same means the chlorides, if
present together, may be separated from one another and subsequently
identified. Systematic analysis consists very largely in the
use of a proper, logical sequence of such precipitation and solution
reactions, and in the drawing of definite conclusions from the results
obtained.</p>

<p>By far the greatest part of the experimental work in qualitative
analysis has to do, then, with solution and precipitation. For
intelligent and accurate analytical work a clear knowledge of the
nature of solution and, in particular, of the simple <em class="italic">laws governing
chemical action in solution</em>, and of those <em class="italic">governing the formation and
the solution of precipitates</em>, is indispensable. The discoveries of van&#160;'t
Hoff, in 1885–8, concerning the nature of solution, and the subsequent
discoveries of Arrhenius, Nernst, Ostwald and others, have
advanced every branch of chemistry, but perhaps no branch has profited
quite so much as the theory of analytical chemistry, which, as
a result of these discoveries, for the first time, received a clear, precise
and satisfying scientific formulation of its empirical
processes.<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>
<a id="p007" class="xxpn">[p007]</a></p>

<p>On account of the fundamental importance of this modern
scientific formulation of the principles of analytical chemistry for
the proper understanding of our subject, we shall consider first
(in Part I) the modern theories of solution, with their experimental
foundations, and we shall then develop the simpler fundamental
laws governing chemical action and physical changes in solution.
The analytical reactions themselves will be utilized as far as
possible as the material for developing these general principles,
so that this study may lead to the desired grasp of the theory of
analysis and yet, at the same time, advance the student's knowledge
of the practice of analysis.</p>

<p>If a concentrated solution of a substance like sugar or cupric
nitrate is allowed to flow into a cylinder of water (<em class="italic">exp.</em> with
cupric nitrate), we find that the outside forces—gravity—tend
to draw the solution, whose specific gravity is greater than that of
water, to the bottom of the cylinder. In this method of proceeding
there is some inevitable mixing of the solution with the
solvent, as the result of friction, but the main portion of the deep
<span id="i020embed">
<img src="images/i020.jpg" width="200" height="424" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><em class="smcap">Fig. 1.</em></span>
</span>
blue solution is drawn to the bottom of the
vessel and forms a blue layer under the colorless
water. A much sharper line of separation
may be obtained by allowing the cupric nitrate
solution to enter a cylinder of water from under
the water (see Fig. 1), the great density of the
nitrate solution causing it to displace the
water without perceptible mixing of the two
liquids (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). If these vessels are left at rest,
it may be noted, from day to day, that the
copper nitrate diffuses further and further into
the pure solvent, and careful examination would
show that the solvent, in turn, diffuses also into
the copper nitrate solution. The process is a
very slow one, but it will continue until a solution
of <em class="italic">uniform concentration</em> is reached, and
this will be the case, whatever the shape of
the vessel may be. If, for the moment, only the copper nitrate be
considered—and what we are developing for the copper nitrate
may be applied equally well, <em class="italic">mutatis mutandis</em>, to the diffusion
of water into the copper nitrate solution—it is obvious
then that copper nitrate in solution <em class="italic">diffuses in all directions</em>, even
against the force of gravity, and it is plain also, that any object,
resisting or arresting such a motion of material particles, must
have a force or pressure exerted upon it. Whatever the ultimate
<a id="p009" class="xxpn">[p009]</a> cause of the motion, whether it is the result of inherent molecular
velocities of the dissolved copper nitrate, or of an attraction between
the solute and the solvent, or both, it is inevitable that a
pressure must result from the impact of the moving solute against
the solvent.<a id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<div id="i020" class="figleft">
<img src="images/i020.jpg" width="200" height="424" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><em class="smcap">Fig. 1.</em></div>
</div>

<p>We have thus phenomena of diffusion of solutes through solvents,
exactly as we have the well-known diffusion of gases, and the two
phenomena are unquestionably very much alike, the solute, like
the gas, tending to diffuse from the place of higher, to that of lower
concentration.<a id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> Likewise, if a solution of uniform concentration
is heated in one part and not in another, the
solute,<a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> like a gas
under similar conditions, will move from the warmer to the colder
part of the solution, as was demonstrated by Soret.<a id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> Without
committing ourselves for the present to any given reason for the
diffusion, we note that the tendency to diffusion is a fact, and we
must accept the conclusion that every obstacle to such diffusion
must have a <em class="italic">pressure</em> exerted upon it.</p>

<p>Now, if a solution is separated from the pure solvent by means
of a so-called <em class="italic">semipermeable membrane</em>, some of the results of this
tendency to diffusion may be demonstrated.</p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p><em class="smcap">Exp.</em> A concentrated solution of cane sugar in water, colored with
some aniline dye, is enclosed in a thimble of parchment paper firmly fastened
to a long narrow glass tube (see Fig. 2) and the cell is placed in a vessel of pure
water. The parchment is not absolutely semipermeable, but it is approximately
so, allowing the solvent, water, to pass, but being practically impervious
to the solute sugar. A Schleicher and Schüll diffusion-thimble, No. 579,
may be used, with advantage, as the thimble. (<em class="italic">Cf.</em> Smith's <em class="italic">Introduction to
Inorganic Chemistry</em>, p. 284.) <a id="p010" class="xxpn">[p010]</a></p></div>

<div id="i022" class="figleft">
<img src="images/i022.jpg" width="200" height="633" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><em class="smcap">Fig. 2.</em></div>
</div>

<p>We observe, presently, that the system is not in a condition of
equilibrium; water passes through the thimble into the sugar
solution and the latter expands, producing a
decided difference of level, and consequently a
hydrostatic pressure, between the liquid in the
cell and the solvent outside of it. We may
note two facts: first, that the change includes
an expansion of the solute,<a id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> the sugar, in the
solution—that is, the tendency of the solute
to expand into larger volumes of the solvent is
satisfied exactly as in the experiment (Fig. 1)
described above. In the second place, like all
natural phenomena which proceed spontaneously,
<em class="italic">the change is in the direction of equilibrium</em>;
for when the hydrostatic pressure on the
solution in the cell becomes sufficiently great,
or if it is made sufficiently great at once by
the application of some outside pressure, <em class="italic">a
point of equilibrium is reached, at which water
will pass neither into the cell nor out of it</em>. At
that point, the tendency to expansion, both of
the solute and of the solvent in the solution,
is just overcome by the pressure on the solution.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Definition of Osmotic Pressure.</h4>—<em class="italic">The hydrostatic
pressure which is necessary to bring the solution into equilibrium
with the pure solvent, when the two are separated by a
semipermeable membrane, may be defined, according to van&#160;'t Hoff,
as the measure of</em> what is called the <em class="italic">osmotic pressure of the solution</em>.
We note that this definition still does not commit us to any theory
as to the origin of the pressure, but merely <em class="italic">formulates</em> an <em class="italic">experimental
relation</em>.</div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Measurement of Osmotic Pressure.</h4>—More perfect semipermeable
membranes can be produced. These make possible
quantitative measurements of the hydrostatic pressure on a solution,
when equilibrium between the solution and the pure solvent
<a id="p011" class="xxpn">[p011]</a> has been reached. Such membranes were first used by Pfeffer.
They consist of certain gelatinous precipitates, notably copper
ferrocyanide. Films of these precipitates may be formed, under
proper conditions, which are permeable to water but not to certain
solutes, such as cane sugar, glucose and galactose.</div>

<div id="i023" class="figright">
<img src="images/i023.jpg" width="200" height="550" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><em class="smcap">Fig. 3.</em></div>
</div>

<p>By precipitating these membranes in the pores of unglazed
clay cells, especially by the process devised by Morse,<a id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> we may
make them sufficiently strong to resist enormous pressures—some
used by the Earl of Berkeley were found to withstand a pressure
of 130 atmospheres. The hydrostatic pressure
required to produce equilibrium may
then be measured in either of two ways.
The first method, used originally by Pfeffer
and more recently by Morse and Frazer<a id="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>
and their collaborators in a wonderfully
conscientious study of osmotic pressures,
consists in allowing the hydrostatic pressure
to establish itself by the passage of very
small quantities of the solvent, through the
membrane, into the tightly closed cell containing
the solution. When the resulting
pressure produces a condition of equilibrium,
it is measured<a id="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> by a manometer connected
with the solution, much as a gas pressure
may be measured (Fig. 3).<a id="FNanchor_10_10" href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> This process
requires considerable time for exact measurements—weeks,
during which the cell must
be kept at a constant temperature. The
second method, which has been used by
Berkeley and Hartley,<a id="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>
is very much more
rapid and requires only a few hours for
the measurement. It consists in having
the pure solvent within the cell, instead of outside of it, and in
<a id="p012" class="xxpn">[p012]</a> exerting an external pressure on the solution outside of the cell,
until a delicate manometer, communicating with the pure solvent,
shows that water does not pass through the membrane in either
direction—equilibrium having been reached.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Osmotic Pressure and the Laws of Gases.</h4>—The work of
van&#160;'t Hoff, which has proved of inestimable value to the development
of chemistry, succeeded in demonstrating that, <em class="italic">for dilute
solutions, the osmotic pressure</em>, as defined above, <em class="italic">obeys the common
laws of gases</em>,<a id="FNanchor_12_12" href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>—<em class="italic">that, in fact, a substance in a dilute solution has
an osmotic pressure equal to the gas pressure which it would exert if
it were a gas of the same volume and at the same temperature</em>.<a id="FNanchor_13_13" href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></div>

<p>Space does not permit the presentation of all the details of
the evidence confirming this conclusion, but some of the most
direct experimental proofs<a id="FNanchor_14_14" href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>
will be considered. <a id="p013" class="xxpn">[p013]</a></p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Boyle's Law.</h4>—Boyle's law
for gases states that, at a constant temperature, the
pressure of a gas changes inversely as its volume, or
directly as its concentration. Mathematically we have <em
class="italic">P</em> : <em class="italic">P′</em> = <em

When van&#160;'t Hoff published his first paper on the subject,
Pfeffer's results from the direct measurement of the osmotic
pressures of cane-sugar solutions were available, and even these,
although experimentally not as exact as more recent determinations,
showed plainly that, at a given temperature, the osmotic pressure of
a sugar solution varies directly as the concentration, or inversely
as the volume containing a given weight of the sugar. At 13–16° we
have:</div>

<p>The ratio of pressure to concentration varies irregularly round
a mean value of 526, and is approximately constant. The more
recent, exceedingly careful measurements of Morse and Frazer
confirm the conclusion, that Boyle's law holds for the osmotic
<a id="p014" class="xxpn">[p014]</a> pressures of dilute solutions; they find that the osmotic pressures
of glucose and of cane-sugar solutions vary directly as the concentrations
of the solutions, at a constant temperature.<a id="FNanchor_15_15" href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Gay-Lussac's Law.</h4>—Gay-Lussac's law for gases states that,
if the volume of gas is kept constant, its pressure increases by 1 / 273
of its value for every degree above 0° C., or <em class="italic">P</em><sub><em class="italic">t</em></sub> = <em class="italic">P</em><sub>0</sub>(1 + <em class="italic">t</em> / 273).</div>

<p>Expressing the temperature in absolute degrees, we have more
simply:</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
<em class="italic">P</em><sub><em class="italic">t</em></sub> = <em class="italic">P</em><sub>0</sub> (<em class="italic">T</em> / 273)  or  P<sub>t</sub> / T = <em class="italic">P</em><sub>0</sub> / 273 = a
 constant.<a id="FNanchor_16_16" href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>
</div></div>

<p>That is, the pressure of a gas varies directly as its absolute temperature,
if the volume is kept constant.</p>

<p>Pfeffer's results, on the osmotic pressure of sugar solutions at
different temperatures, were not sufficiently accurate to enable
van&#160;'t Hoff to use them to confirm positively the rigorous thermodynamic
proof (footnote 3, p. <a href="#p012">12</a>), that the osmotic pressure must
increase proportionally to the absolute temperature, as required
by Gay-Lussac's law. But the data did show, uniformly, a marked
increase of the osmotic pressure with the temperature and, frequently,
excellent agreement between theory and experiment.
More striking were the results obtained by van&#160;'t Hoff in testing
the correctness of this extension of Gay-Lussac's law by means of
Soret's results on the diffusion of a solute from a warmer to a
colder place. It was found that the concentrations, obtained by
Soret when equilibrium was reached, agreed closely with the
demand that the osmotic pressures in the colder and the warmer
parts of the solution should be equal, and that the osmotic pressure
of a given weight of solute in a given volume should increase
proportionally to the absolute temperature. An elevation of
temperature, in a portion of a uniform solution, will increase the
osmotic pressure of this part. Diffusion will follow, until the
loss in concentration of the solute, and therefore the loss of osmotic
pressure (Boyle's law), of the warmer part, and the increased
concentration and increased pressure of the colder portion result
in all parts of the solution having the same osmotic pressure.
<a id="p015" class="xxpn">[p015]</a> As an example, a concentration of 17.33% copper sulphate at
20° was found to be in equilibrium with a concentration of 14.03%
at 80°. Now, if the 17.33% solution had an osmotic pressure of
<em class="italic">P</em> mm. at 20°, a 14.03% solution at the same temperature would
have a pressure of (14.03 / 17.33) × <em class="italic">P</em> mm. (Boyle's law), and this
would increase to (14.03 / 17.33) × <em class="italic">P</em> × (353 / 293) mm. at 80° C.,
or 0.975 <em class="italic">P</em> mm.—a result showing that the osmotic pressure in
the hot part was practically the same as that, (<em class="italic">P</em>), in the cold part
of the solution.<a id="FNanchor_17_17" href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>It is a source of great satisfaction, that the recent very exact
and painstaking work of Morse and Frazer,<a id="FNanchor_18_18" href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> in measuring osmotic
pressures directly, completely confirms this fundamentally important
conclusion, that the osmotic pressure of a solution does
increase proportionally to its absolute temperature.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Avogadro-van&#160;'t Hoff Hypothesis.</h4>—For chemists, the
most important part of van&#160;'t Hoff's work lies in the extension of
<em class="italic">the Avogadro Hypothesis</em> to solutions. As van&#160;'t Hoff expresses it,
"equal volumes of the most different solutions, having the same
osmotic pressure and the same temperature, contain the same number
of dissolved molecules,—that number, namely, which would
be found in the same volume of a gas at the same gas pressure
and temperature."<a id="FNanchor_19_19" href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> <a id="p016" class="xxpn">[p016]</a></div>

<p>Pfeffer's measurements, with solutions of 1 g. of sugar in 100 c.c.
of water (the volume of the solution is 100.6 c.c.), were shown to
prove, that the observed osmotic pressures agreed excellently with
the gas pressures, calculated for the equimolar weight of hydrogen,
in the same volume and at the same temperature:</p>

<p>Morse's more recent and more exact results show, that the
osmotic pressure of solutions of cane sugar and of glucose (corrected
for the volume occupied by the sugar, see footnote, p. <a href="#p015">15</a>) agrees
within 6% with the values demanded by van&#160;'t Hoff's theory,
being about 6% larger for concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1.0
molar. The difference of 6% is noteworthy and is probably due
to secondary causes, but suggests extended investigation of its
source.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Indirect Determinations of Osmotic Pressure.</h4>—The experimental
results given have been obtained by direct measurements
of osmotic pressures with the aid of semipermeable membranes.
<a id="p017" class="xxpn">[p017]</a> Perfect membranes are very difficult to prepare, and membranes
of this kind can be used only with a few solutes. Nature offers
us, however, forms of semipermeable "walls" between solutions
and pure solvents, which in many instances are perfect. The
atmosphere, above a volatile pure solvent and a solution of a nonvolatile
substance in that solvent, when both liquids are placed side
by side in a closed space, would serve as a semipermeable wall:
the solvent vaporizes and may pass freely from solvent to solution
and <em class="italic">vice versa</em>, but the solute, in the case under consideration, is
nonvolatile and therefore cannot pass through the atmosphere.
The vapor pressure of a pure solvent being always found to be
higher than that of a solution in this solvent, at the same temperature,
the solvent would pass in such a closed space as vapor <em class="italic">from
the pure solvent</em> and would <em class="italic">condense</em> in the solution; it thereby
dilutes the solution and the solute, and the solvent in the solution,
expand, exactly as in the absorption of a solvent by a solution
through a semipermeable membrane. Again, the vapor pressure
of a solution being lower than that of the pure solvent, the solution
(of a nonvolatile solute) must be heated higher than the pure
solvent, to bring both to the boiling-point; that is, there is an
<em class="italic">elevation of the boiling-point</em>, when a nonvolatile solute is dissolved
in a solvent. The solute being nonvolatile, only the solvent
passes off in the process of boiling, the solute becomes <em class="italic">more concentrated</em>,
and, according to van&#160;'t Hoff's extension of Boyle's
law, the <em class="italic">osmotic pressure of the solution increases</em>. Similarly,
when a solution is cooled until freezing occurs, provided the
solute does not crystallize out with the solvent, the concentration
of the solute is again increased, and therefore the <em class="italic">osmotic pressure</em>
of the solution is also increased. Van&#160;'t Hoff recognized the
relations existing between the freezing, boiling and vaporization
of solutions, on the one hand, and the changes of their osmotic
pressures on the other. By developing rigorously the <em class="italic">relations
between the lowering of the vapor tension, the raising of the boiling-point,
the lowering of the freezing-point</em> of a solvent by a solute
<em class="italic">and the osmotic pressure of the solution</em>, he made it possible<a id="FNanchor_21_21" href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> to use
<a id="p018" class="xxpn">[p018]</a> extensive experimental material,<a id="FNanchor_22_22" href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> on the elevation of boiling-points
and the lowering of freezing-points and of vapor tensions, to
determine the osmotic pressures of solutions. The theory of the
relation of osmotic pressure to gas pressure is fully confirmed by
these measurements, for those cases to which it may properly be
applied, namely, to sufficiently dilute solutions and such as
have only negligible heats of dilution, <em class="italic">i.e.</em> in which dilution does
not involve chemical changes.</div>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<div class="h4p"><h4>Apparent Exceptions.</h4>—Instead of discussing the vast amount of material
of this kind, which agrees with van&#160;'t Hoff's theory, we may consider, more
profitably, typical cases of <em class="italic">apparent exceptions</em>. The most important instance
of this kind, the case of solutions of compounds which undergo <em class="italic">electrolytic
dissociation or ionization</em>, will be separately discussed in the next chapter, and
we shall find that van&#160;'t Hoff's great generalization is a vital element in
the evidence of this important form of dissociation. Of other apparent exceptions,
we may note the fact that some solutes seem to give "abnormally"
<em class="italic">low</em> osmotic pressures<a id="FNanchor_23_23" href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> in certain solutions. For instance, benzoic acid,
in benzene solutions, gives only a little more than half as great an osmotic
pressure as it does in aqueous solutions of the same concentration and temperature,
and as would be calculated on the basis of the Avogadro-van&#160;'t Hoff
Hypothesis for a compound of the formula C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>COOH and the molecular
weight 122. But a rigorous study<a id="FNanchor_24_24" href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> of the distribution of benzoic acid between
water and benzene, when solutions of the acid in the two solvents are
shaken together until equilibrium is established (Chapter VIII), has proved that
the distribution is strictly in accord with the assumption that benzoic acid,
in aqueous solution, has the molecular weight 122 and the composition
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>COOH, and that, in benzene solution, it has the molecular weight 244
and the composition
(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>COOH)<sub>2</sub>;
only a <em class="italic">small part</em> of the acid (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>COOH)<sub>2</sub>
is decomposed in benzene solution into the simpler molecules, of the composition
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>COOH. In other words, the simpler molecules C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>COOH are
<em class="italic">polymerized</em> or <em class="italic">associated</em> to form larger molecules in benzene solution, much as
the gas nitrogen dioxide NO<sub>2</sub> goes over more or less into the gas N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, especially
at low temperatures, and as hydrogen fluoride at low temperatures has
the composition H<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>, while at higher temperatures it is HF. The divergence
of the benzene solutions of benzoic acid from the Avogadro-van&#160;'t Hoff principle
is therefore only an <em class="italic">apparent one</em>, not a real one, inasmuch as the
osmotic pressure of the solutions agrees perfectly with that calculated for
solutions of a substance (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>COOH)<sub>2</sub>, of molecular weight 244. Such
associated molecules (of organic acids, alcohols, phenols, etc.) occur
<a id="p019" class="xxpn">[p019]</a> particularly readily in liquids of small dissociating power, like benzene, and
such solutions show marked <em class="italic">absorption of heat on dilution</em>,<a id="FNanchor_25_25" href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> the dilution being
accompanied by a <em class="italic">chemical change</em>. The associated molecules are dissociated
more and more completely [(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>COOH)<sub>2</sub> ⇄ 2 C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>COOH], even in these
solvents, as the solutions are diluted. Since dilution results in a <em class="italic">chemical
increase</em> in the number of molecules, the osmotic pressure cannot decrease proportionally
with the increase of volume in such a case as this. Nor does gas
pressure, it must be remembered, decrease proportionally to the volume in
the case of gases which show <em class="italic">chemical changes</em> with change of volume, <em class="italic">e.g.</em> in
the case of nitrogen tetroxide, for which we have N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> ⇄ 2 NO<sub>2</sub>.</div>

<p>In still other instances, apparently too high osmotic pressures, or too low
molecular weights, have been found by the application of the Avogadro-van&#160;'t
Hoff Hypothesis to solutions: for instance, the molecular weight of
sodium, when dissolved in mercury, was found by Ramsay to vary from 21.6,
in dilute, to 15.1 in concentrated solutions. But Cady found that the heat
of dilution of sodium in mercury solution is considerable, and by taking
this properly into account, Bancroft was able to show that the molecular
weight, correctly calculated in a given experiment, is 22.7 (agreeing well with
the theoretical weight 23), in place of 16.5, as calculated without making the
required allowance for the heat of dilution.<a id="FNanchor_26_26" href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> These determinations are most
instructive in showing that the sources of some of the most important deviations
from the van&#160;'t Hoff-Avogadro principle, deviations which have been
brought forward as arguments against its assumptions, are due, not to any
untrustworthiness of the general principle, but to the error of neglecting to
observe the limiting conditions of the formulation, or of neglecting to make
corresponding corrections for the non-observance thereof.</p></div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Summary.</h4>—Van&#160;'t Hoff's theory of solution—that the osmotic
pressure of substances in solution obeys the laws of gases, and that
equal volumes of the most varied dilute solutions, having the same
temperature and osmotic pressure, contain the same number of
dissolved molecules, that number, namely, which would be found
in the same volume of a gas at the same temperature and gas
pressure,—accords thus, not only with the demands of thermodynamics,<a id="FNanchor_27_27" href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a>
but is also, within the limits demanded by the theory
itself, in agreement with the best experimental measurements of
osmotic pressures that have been made in recent years. The apparent
exceptions, as in the cases just described and, as we shall
find, in the case of electrolytic dissociation, are found to be no
exceptions, when the conclusions, reached on the assumption that
<a id="p020" class="xxpn">[p020]</a> the theory is correct, are tested rigorously by independent methods
of investigation.<a id="FNanchor_28_28" href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></div>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p>The fundamental laws of gases and the Avogadro Hypothesis may be condensed
into the following general equation, expressing all of the laws, viz.:
<em class="italic">P</em> <em class="italic">V</em> = <em class="italic">n</em> <em class="italic">R</em> <em class="italic">T</em>. This equation applies equally to the osmotic pressures of dilute
solutions, the osmotic pressure being substituted for the gas pressure. In
the equation, <em class="italic">T</em> is the absolute temperature of the gas or solution, <em class="italic">P</em> the gaseous
or osmotic pressure, <em class="italic">V</em> the free space of the gas volume, <em class="italic">i.e.</em> the volume of
the gas less the volume occupied by the gas molecules, or the volume of the
pure solvent in the solution used, <em class="italic">i.e.</em> the volume of the solution less the volume
of the solute. <em class="italic">R</em> is the so-called <em class="italic">gas-constant</em>, and represents <em class="italic">the work</em> done
against the external pressure when one gram molecule, or mole, of the gas is
heated one degree and allowed to expand, say at constant pressure <em class="italic">P</em>, against
an external pressure <em class="italic">P</em>; <em class="italic">n</em> represents the number of gram molecules or moles
of gas or solute used (the total weight of solute or gas, divided by the average
weight of a mole in the gas or solute). If a given weight of a gas or solute
is taken, and no dissociation or association occurs (such as would involve appreciable
heats of dilution), then <em class="italic">n</em> is a given number; and, therefore, at a given temperature
<em class="italic">T</em>, all the factors on the right side of the general equation being given
numbers, <em class="italic">P</em> <em class="italic">V</em> <em class="italic">is a constant</em> (Boyle's law). For a given quantity of gas or solute
(<em class="italic">n</em> is a given number), kept at <em class="italic">constant volume</em> <em class="italic">V</em>, the pressure must vary as the
absolute temperature (Gay-Lussac's law); <em class="italic">P</em> / <em class="italic">T</em> = <em class="italic">n</em> <em class="italic">R</em> / <em class="italic">V</em> = <em class="italic">a constant</em>. When the
pressure, volume and temperature of two gases, or two dilute solutions, are
equal, <em class="italic">n</em>, the number of gas or solute molecules present, must be the same
(Avogadro-van&#160;'t Hoff Hypothesis); <em class="italic">n</em> = <em class="italic">P</em> <em class="italic">V</em> / (<em class="italic">R</em> <em class="italic">T</em>), and all the factors of the
right side are the same for the gases and solutions which we are comparing.
Finally, if the pressure is expressed in atmospheres, the volume in litres, and
the temperature in absolute degrees, the <em class="italic">gas-constant</em>

Even after a solution of uniform concentration of the solute is formed,
the tendency toward diffusion, and the diffusion itself, and the resulting pressure
must still persist. But a state of <em class="italic">dynamic</em> (or flowing) <em class="italic">equilibrium</em> must be
considered now to exist, the loss caused by the moving away of the solute, from
a given part of the solution, being balanced by the diffusion (into that part) of
the solute from the neighboring parts. Whether one ascribes the diffusion to
inherent molecular velocities of the solute, or to an attraction between solvent
and solute, the discrete particles of the solute in a solution of uniform concentration
will continue to have such inherent velocities (Chap. III), and
will also continue to be surrounded by pure solvent, exactly as in solutions
of unequal concentrations, where the diffusion may be observed, because the
net result, in such a case, is a one-sided action.</p></div>

When appreciable <em class="italic">heat of dilution</em> is shown by a solution, some chemical
change, resulting from dilution, is indicated (such as, dissociation of the solute,
hydration, hydrolysis, etc.). In such a case, the Avogadro-van&#160;'t Hoff principle
holds for each concentration for its actual composition, and the principle
may often be used to determine the extent of the chemical change produced
by dilution. But then the osmotic pressure will not obey Boyle's and Gay-Lussac's
laws. The same exception applies also to gases which undergo
chemical changes, as the result of dilution or change of temperature. In the
case, for instance, of nitrogen tetroxide, which dissociates according to
N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> ⇄ 2 NO<sub>2</sub>, the extent of the dissociation varies with changes of concentration
(pressure) and of temperature, and the gas does not obey the laws
of Gay-Lussac and of Boyle. In regard to the rôle of heat of dilution in
connection with osmotic pressure, see Bancroft, <em class="italic">J. Phys. Chem.</em>, <em class="bold">10</em>, 319

As a result of numerous vain endeavors, as well as of much direct evidence
of a positive character, the scientific world has, for many years, held the
opinion that any sort of "perpetual motion machine" is impossible. Every
one now admits that a machine which would be able to work continuously,
without consuming energy, is an impossibility—that is, that a "<em class="italic">perpetuum
mobile of the first class</em>," as it is called, is impossible (law of the conservation
of energy or <em class="italic">first law</em> of thermodynamics). From this law it does not of
necessity follow, however, that it would be impossible to make a machine or
device that would convert <em class="italic">continuously</em> into available energy or work, say, the
enormous amounts of heat energy of the earth or of large bodies of water
("dissipated energy") which would thereby be <em class="italic">cooled below</em> the temperatures
of their surroundings. Such a hypothetical process has been termed a "<em class="italic">perpetuum
mobile of the second class</em>"; it has never been realized and is universally
conceded to be an impossibility; the so-called "<em class="italic">second law</em> of thermodynamics"
gives expression to this fact.
</p>
<p>
Now van&#160;'t Hoff [<em class="italic">Z. phys. Chem.</em>, <em class="bold">1</em>, 481 (1887)] showed, first, that a gas like
oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, etc., which is soluble in proportion to its
gas pressure (Henry's law), must exert, in solution, an osmotic pressure equal
to the gas pressure, which it would have, if present in the same quantity as a
gas in the same volume at the same temperature; for, if such were not the
case, the solution and gas could be used to produce a <em class="italic">perpetuum mobile of
the second class</em>, which, according to the above law, is an impossibility. Similar
proofs were given by Rayleigh [<em class="italic">Nature</em>, <em class="bold">55</em>, 253 (1897)] and by Larmor
[<em class="italic">Phil. Trans.</em>, <em class="bold">190</em>, 266 (1897), <em class="italic">Nature</em>, <em class="bold">55</em>, 545 (1897)] that the principle applies
to solutions of other solutes.</p>

<p>Provided, then, that we have (1) perfect semipermeable membranes,
(2) sufficiently dilute solutions, and (3) none but negligible heats of dilution
(p. <a href="#p012">12</a>), van&#160;'t Hoff's generalization, concerning the relation of osmotic pressure
and the laws of gases, must hold, if the <em class="italic">perpetuum mobile of the second class</em>
is impossible, as is demanded by the second law of thermodynamics.</p></div>

temperature, <em class="italic">in the volume occupied by the pure

the volume of the solution and the volume of the solvent may be

is the volume of the solvent alone, <em class="italic">i.e.</em>
the volume of the solution reduced by the volume of the pure

<p>Accepting van&#160;'t Hoff's theory of solutions, then, as based on
experimental evidence as well as on sound thermodynamic reasoning,
we find a number of interesting questions still confronting us.
Most insistent is the question as to the source of the remarkable
agreement between the osmotic pressure of a solute and the gas
pressure, which it would exert in the same volume, as a gas, at the
same temperature, and as to the identity of the laws governing
the two forms of pressure. Then, we may also ask, what is the
mechanism of the process by which osmotic pressure reveals
itself, especially in the case of cells with semipermeable membranes.
And, finally, we may ask what is the cause of the semipermeability
of the membranes.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Semipermeability.</h4>—Taking up the last question first, as
the simplest one, we find that it was long ago recognized that
permeability depends on the power of membranes to dissolve
certain substances, or to form unstable combinations with them.
A membrane is semipermeable if it will dissolve one component
only of a solution, the solute or the solvent, and not the
other.<a id="FNanchor_29_29" href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></div>

<p>We find the simplest evidence of the cause of semipermeability
in the case of gases. Palladium, especially when heated, dissolves
hydrogen readily, but not nitrogen or oxygen, and a wall of palladium
may be used as a semipermeable membrane to separate a
mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen from pure hydrogen, just as
copper ferrocyanide membranes are used with aqueous sugar
solutions and water. The results with the gases duplicate in
every particular the observations made on the solutions (see
below, p. <a href="#p024">24</a>). Certain gases, such as ammonia and hydrogen
chloride, are easily soluble in water, while others, like oxygen,
nitrogen and hydrogen, are very difficultly soluble, and a film of
<a id="p022" class="xxpn">[p022]</a> water may be used as a semipermeable membrane for such
gases.<a id="FNanchor_30_30" href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p><em class="smcap">Exp.</em> If the moist membrane of a cell (Fig. 4), containing air, is covered
with an atmosphere of hydrogen, there is no increase of pressure produced
in the cell, as indicated by the column of colored
oil in the manometer in which the cell ends:
hydrogen, being very little soluble in water,
cannot pass through the film of water in the
few minutes it is allowed to act. If now an
atmosphere of ammonia is substituted for the
hydrogen, the gas passes through the film into
the cell. It turns the color of a piece of litmus
paper placed in the cell and produces an increased
pressure in the cell, the air remaining in
the latter, because oxygen and nitrogen are very
little soluble in water.</p></div>

<p>Membranes will be, similarly, semipermeable
to solvent or solute, when only
one of these is soluble in the membrane,
or is capable of forming an unstable
compound with it. For instance, salts,
holding water of crystallization which is
readily lost and recovered, may easily be
conceived of as assuming the rôle of semipermeable
membranes, allowing the passage of water say from a
wet atmosphere to a dry one, or from pure water to a solution;
and Tammann<a id="FNanchor_31_31" href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> has realized such membranes by the use of zeolites—silicates,
which hold water of crystallization but are insoluble
in water. Kahlenberg<a id="FNanchor_32_32" href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> has recently used rubber membranes, that
are permeable for solvents like benzene, pyridine, etc., which are
soluble in rubber, but not permeable for water, which is insoluble
in rubber.</p>

</div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Osmosis.</h4>—The recognition of this rôle of the semipermeable
membrane leads to the second question raised, namely as to the
mechanism of the process by means of which osmotic pressures
are measured directly with the aid of such membranes (p. <a href="#p011">11</a>).
<a id="p023" class="xxpn">[p023]</a> The answer hinges on the question of the mechanism of the
diffusion of the solvent into the cell, a diffusion which is called its
osmosis.<a id="FNanchor_33_33" href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> If we consider the pure solvent, say water, on one side
of a semipermeable membrane, and a solution (<em class="italic">e.g.</em> of sugar in
water) on the other side, it is obvious that the <em class="italic">solvent</em> itself has a
<em class="italic">higher concentration</em> on the side where it is pure, than on the side
of the solution, where it is diluted—distended by the solute in it.
The solvent is soluble in the membrane, and its solubility will be
proportional<a id="FNanchor_34_34" href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> to its own (the solvent's) concentration; it will,
consequently, be more soluble in the membrane on the side of the
pure solvent than on the side of the solution. If we bring such a
membrane first into contact with the pure solvent (Fig. 5), the
membrane will take up the solvent (from the side <em class="italic">A</em>) until it is
<em class="italic">saturated</em> with it. Let the solubility, which
represents the concentration of the solvent in
the membrane at this stage, be called <em class="italic">c</em>. The
membrane may then be considered to be taking
up in unit time just as many molecules from the
solvent as it gives up to it (dynamic equilibrium),
exactly as, when water is in equilibrium with
water vapor, we consider the water to be vaporizing just as
fast as vapor is condensing to form water. Now, if a solution
of sugar is placed on the other side of the membrane, the
solvent will pass out of the membrane into the solution just
as fast as it passes back into the pure solvent. At first the
concentration of the solvent on the surface <em class="italic">B</em> of the membrane
is just as great <span class="ibnowrap">(<em class="italic">c</em>)</span> as on the surface <em class="italic">A</em>; but <em class="italic">the membrane will
here receive the solvent more slowly from the solution, which is
less concentrated as to the solvent</em>; and consequently the membrane
<em class="italic">will lose water to the solution</em>. The solubility <span class="ibnowrap">(<em class="italic">c′</em>)</span> of the
solvent at this surface <em class="italic">B</em> of the membrane, corresponding to the
smaller concentration of the solvent in the solution, will be less
than the solubility <span class="ibnowrap">(<em class="italic">c</em>)</span> at <em class="italic">A</em>, where the membrane is in contact
with the pure solvent, and water will pass into the solution at <em class="italic">B</em>,
until the concentration of the water in the membrane at <em class="italic">B</em> has fallen
<a id="p024" class="xxpn">[p024]</a> from <span class="ibnowrap">(<em class="italic">c</em>)</span> to <span class="ibnowrap">(<em class="italic">c′</em>)</span>. In such a membrane, as in every solution or
gas, there must be a tendency towards the establishing of uniform
concentration by diffusion from points of higher concentration
to those of lower, and the solvent will, therefore, <em class="italic">diffuse from
points along the surface A of the membrane to points along the surface
B</em>; the surface <em class="italic">A</em> will become <em class="italic">unsaturated</em> and will take
up solvent from the pure liquid bathing it, and the surface <em class="italic">B</em> will
be kept continuously supersaturated and will lose solvent continually
to the solution. Consequently, the solvent will pass
continuously through the membrane from the pure solvent to
the solution. Equilibrium will be reached, and the flow will
cease, only <em class="italic">when the solution has become infinitely dilute</em>, equal
hydrostatic pressure obtaining on solution and solvent, or <em class="italic">when
the disturbing influence of the solute, which dilutes the solvent in the
solution, is exactly counterbalanced by an external hydrostatic pressure,
exerted on the solution</em>. When such a pressure on the surface
of the solution balances the force exerted against the solvent by
the solute we shall have equilibrium. It is clear, then, that the
<em class="italic">osmosis</em>, or passage of the solvent through the membrane, is brought
about by the unequal concentrations (or, more exactly, the resulting
<em class="italic">unequal partial pressures</em>) <em class="italic">of the solvent itself. But this inequality
is produced by the presence of the solute, and it is a characteristic and
significant fact, that the effect of the latter, in dilute solutions, may be
overcome by a hydrostatic pressure, corresponding to the gas pressure
which the same number of molecules of a gas in the same volume at
the same temperature would exert against this hydrostatic pressure</em>.</div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Osmosis and Gas Pressure.</h4>—The legitimacy of the interpretation
given is most strikingly shown by experiments with a membrane,
semipermeable for gases, which enables us to measure gas
pressures, that may be unknown, by exactly the same process as
is used to measure the unknown osmotic pressure of a solute in
solution. Van&#160;'t Hoff<a id="FNanchor_35_35" href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> and Arrhenius<a id="FNanchor_36_36" href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> predicted such a result,
and Ramsay<a id="FNanchor_37_37" href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> proved by experiment the correctness of their
assumptions. A mixture of nitrogen and hydrogen may be
enclosed in a palladium vessel connected with a manometer (see
Fig. 6).<a id="FNanchor_38_38" href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> The partial pressure <em class="italic">P</em><sub><em class="italic">N</em></sub> of the nitrogen may be
<a id="p025" class="xxpn">[p025]</a> determined by surrounding the palladium vessel with pure hydrogen,
at a pressure which is known and is greater than the partial pressure
of the hydrogen in the
vessel, and by observing
the final total gas pressure
which is obtained in the
vessel. The hydrogen diffuses
from the point of
higher concentration, outside
of the vessel, through
the palladium, into the
interior where the concentration
of the hydrogen
is lower. The experiment
may be carried out at 280°,
a temperature at which
palladium readily dissolves
hydrogen and is permeable
to it. The metal does not dissolve nitrogen and is not permeable
to it. The volume of the enclosed gas is kept constant by
raising the mercury level in the outside arm of the manometer,
and the total pressure of the enclosed gas is measured when equilibrium
is reached. If this total pressure is <em class="italic">P</em><sub>final</sub> and the known
pressure of the hydrogen outside of the vessel is <em class="italic">P</em><sub><em class="italic">H</em></sub>, then, if equilibrium
is reached when the hydrogen on both sides of the semipermeable
palladium membrane has the same concentration
(pressure), <em class="italic">P</em><sub><em class="italic">H</em></sub> + <em class="italic">P</em><sub><em class="italic">N</em></sub> = <em class="italic">P</em><sub>final</sub> and <em class="italic">P</em><sub><em class="italic">N</em></sub> = <em class="italic">P</em><sub>final</sub> − <em class="italic">P</em><sub><em class="italic">H</em></sub>. In other
words, the excess of the final combined pressure inside, over the
outside pressure of the hydrogen, <em class="italic">is equal to the pressure of the
nitrogen in the vessel</em>. Ramsay's results showed that the amount
of hydrogen actually entering the vessel was 90–97% of the
amount predicted by the theory on the basis of the assumption
that equilibrium will be reached, when the hydrogen has the same
concentration (pressure) on both sides of the palladium membrane.</div>

<p>The experiment is particularly instructive, in the first place,
because it illustrates with a gas, subject to the laws of gases, why
and how osmosis takes place through a semipermeable membrane—namely
as a result of the solubility of the diffusing substance in
the membrane, and through the flow of the diffusing substance
<a id="p026" class="xxpn">[p026]</a> from higher to lower concentrations. In the second place, while
the increase in total pressure in the inner chamber undoubtedly
is <em class="italic">brought about</em> by the <em class="italic">osmosis</em> of <em class="italic">hydrogen</em> into the chamber, the
excess pressure when equilibrium has been reached, necessarily
measures accurately the partial pressure of the <em class="italic">nitrogen</em>. In
other words, the semipermeable membrane is merely a means
or <em class="italic">device for measuring</em> the partial pressure of the nitrogen—the
membrane is not the <em class="italic">cause</em> of the pressure; the latter is a definite
one, whether we know what it is or not, and the osmosis of the
hydrogen through the palladium merely gives us a means of
ascertaining it. Similarly, it would be wrong to consider that the
osmotic pressure of a solution is caused, or brought about, by
the flow of the solvent through a semipermeable membrane
(osmosis); the latter simply is a <em class="italic">device</em> which enables us to recognize
and <em class="italic">measure</em> the pressure that exists in the solution, both in the
presence and the absence of such a membrane.</p>

<p>We may consider, then, that the osmosis, or migration of the
solvent through a semipermeable membrane into a solution, is
the result of the reduced concentration (or <em class="italic">partial pressure</em>) of the
solvent in the solution, resulting from the presence of the solute.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the <em class="italic">effect</em> of the <em class="italic">solute</em> on the solvent can be
overcome by a <em class="italic">pressure</em> on the surface of the solution, one is led to
the conclusion that the solute acts by exerting, in turn, <em class="italic">a force or
pressure</em> against the surfaces of the solvent, in the directions opposite
to the hydrostatic pressure required to overcome it. The significant
identity of the value of this pressure, as thus measured, with
the gas pressure that would be exerted by a gas of the same number
of molecules, in the same volume and at the same temperature,
leads us to the last of the three questions which have been raised,
namely, the question concerning the theory of the intimate relations
between gas and osmotic pressures (p. <a href="#p021">21</a>).</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Kinetic Theory and Osmotic Pressure.</h4>—For an answer
to this fundamentally interesting theoretical question one turns,
naturally, to the kinetic theory, which, in the hands of Clausius,
Joule, van der Waals and others, has given us a very satisfactory
and essentially complete theoretical interpretation of the behavior
of gases, and of the liquids to which they may be compressed.</div>

<p>The laws of gases, it is known, are in accord with the two simple
assumptions of the kinetic theory. The first assumption is that
<a id="p027" class="xxpn">[p027]</a> gases consist of ultimate discrete particles (molecules), which
move in all directions through the space filled by the gas and,
at ordinary pressures, are so far apart, that the forces of molecular
attraction between them are negligible; the <em class="italic">pressure</em> of the
gas is simply the net result of the impacts of these flying particles
upon the walls of the containing vessel. The second assumption
of the kinetic theory is that <em class="italic">temperature</em> is a function of the mean
kinetic energy of the moving molecules, and that the molecules of
gases of the same temperature have the same mean kinetic energy.
The kinetic energy of particles is a function of their mass <em class="italic">m</em> and
their velocity <em class="italic">u</em> (K.E. = ½ <em class="italic">m</em> <em class="italic">u</em><sup>2</sup>). When a gas is heated, the
kinetic energy of its molecules is increased, and, since their masses
remain unchanged, their velocity must increase. As a result, the
number and the force of their impacts against the walls of a given
space increase, and thus the pressure is increased.</p>

<p>We may ask, whether this theory cannot be used to explain the
connection between osmotic and gaseous pressure. If temperature
is a function of the kinetic energy of the molecules of which a substance
consists,—and the whole behavior of gases confirms such
a conception,—then one must conclude, that the mean kinetic
energy of molecules, at a given temperature, must always be the
same, irrespective of whether they are present in gaseous, or liquid,
or solid form, or even in solution.<a id="FNanchor_39_39" href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> The tendency of the molecules
to move, resulting from the kinetic energy inherent at a given
temperature, may be largely balanced (liquids), or overcome
(solids), by molecular attractions of surrounding particles, but
such conditions are altogether in harmony with the conception of
a definite mean molecular kinetic energy, persisting at a given
temperature, irrespective of the physical surroundings of the
molecule. According to the kinetic theory, then, when we have
a dilute solution, say of alcohol in water, the molecules of alcohol,
at a given temperature, would have a given mean kinetic energy,
<a id="p028" class="xxpn">[p028]</a> and would be tending to move in all directions with a mass<a id="FNanchor_40_40" href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> and
velocity, the same as if the alcohol were present as a gas or vapor
at the same temperature. If the solution is sufficiently dilute,
the dissolved alcohol molecules are sufficiently far apart, for
average time, to make the molecular attractions between them
negligible, just as is assumed for gases. As far as the alcohol
(solute) molecules alone are concerned, they may, evidently, be
assumed to be present in the solution, in the same condition, as
to number, mean kinetic energy and mean velocity, as they would
be in alcohol vapor of the same concentration and temperature.
We may ask, now, whether the osmotic pressure of the solution
may not result from the pressure on the solvent, growing out of
its bombardment by the solute molecules. And we may ask,
further, what numerical relation would subsist between such a
pressure and the pressure of the solute, if the latter were present
as a gas, under the same conditions of temperature and concentration.
In order to be prepared to answer these questions, we
must consider, in what way the presence of the solvent must
modify the motions and the forces of impact of solute molecules.</p>

<p>One great difference between the dissolved substance and the gas
would be, that, in the solution, the solute is in intimate contact with
the <em class="italic">solvent</em>. A decided attraction must exist between the solute
molecules and the solvent molecules, since we could not otherwise
understand how a solvent, like water, in dissolving a nonvolatile
substance like sugar, could overcome those molecular
attractions between the sugar molecules, which make sugar a
solid. But we note, that all the solute molecules in a solution,
except those at the surface, are surrounded on all sides equally
by the solvent. The attractive forces, exerted upon the single
molecules of the solute by the solvent molecules, thus sum up to
<em class="italic">zero</em>, and need not be considered further. Only the small number
of solute molecules, which are at the surface of the liquid, would
involve a minor correction in the application of the kinetic theory,
and this need not be considered here.</p>

<p>A second point of difference between a substance in solution,
and the same substance as a gas or vapor at the same temperature
<a id="p029" class="xxpn">[p029]</a> in the same volume, lies in the fact that a gas molecule will go a
much greater distance without colliding with some second molecule
and changing its path, than would a solute molecule, the latter
molecule being closely surrounded by the molecules of the solvent.
The mean <em class="italic">free path</em>, as it is called, will be very much shorter for a
solute molecule than for a gas molecule, and we note, as a matter
of fact, how slow is the diffusion through a solvent (see <em class="italic">exp.</em> p. <a href="#p008">8</a>).
But the shortness of the previous path <em class="italic">does not affect the force of
a blow resulting from the impact of a moving mass</em>, the force of
the impact being dependent only on the mass and the change in
speed of the striking particle, at the moment of impact. Thus the
short free mean path of a dissolved molecule does not affect the
mean <em class="italic">force</em> of the blow, <em class="italic">delivered when it strikes the resisting
medium</em>.</p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p>The slow diffusion of a dissolved substance represents a difference in
degree, not in kind, between gases and dissolved substances. Even in
gases, we have such frequent collisions that the mean free path of an oxygen
molecule at 0° and atmospheric pressure is only 0.00001 cm., whereas the
velocity, the total path covered in one second, is 42,500 cm.</p>

<p><em class="smcap">Exp.</em> If a bulb containing a few drops of bromine is broken at the bottom
of a tall cylinder, the bromine vapor is seen to diffuse rather slowly into the
upper part of the cylinder, the bromine molecules, in their passage upward,
rebounding from the air molecules, with which the cylinder is filled. If a
second cylinder is first evacuated, and the bromine bulb is broken <em class="italic">in vacuo</em>,
the vapor is seen to fill the cylinder instantly, the high velocity of the bromine
molecules being thus revealed.</p></div>

<p>But a third question, of fundamental importance in the comparison
of the condition of a substance existing as a gas and its condition
in a solution of the same concentration and temperature, results
from a consideration of the <em class="italic">frequency of the impacts</em> of the solute
molecules against the solvent, growing out of the reduction of
the lengths of the mean free paths of the solute molecules.<a id="FNanchor_41_41" href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> In
order to be able to take this fact properly into account, it will be
necessary to consider somewhat more precisely the manner in
which, according to the kinetic theory, gas pressure is produced.</p>

<p>We may consider that we have in a cube of unit volume (1 c.c.)
<em class="italic">n</em> molecules of a gas, each of mass <em
class="italic">m</em> and average velocity <em class="italic">u</em>
cm. per second. We may assume that one-third of the total number
<a id="p030" class="xxpn">[p030]</a> of molecules moves in
each of the three dimensional directions.<a id="FNanchor_42_42"
href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> A single molecule of
mass <em class="italic">m</em>, striking the surface with a velocity
<em class="italic">u</em> and rebounding with the same velocity in
the opposite direction, will exert on the surface a force of 2 <em
class="italic">m</em> <em class="italic">u</em> units. But, with a
velocity of <em class="italic">u</em> cm. per second, it will reach
the opposite wall and return to the surface we are considering, <em
class="italic">u</em> / 2 times in one second. A single molecule
will consequently exert a force 2 <em class="italic">m</em> <em
class="italic">u</em> × <em class="italic">u</em> / 2 or <em
class="italic">m</em> <em class="italic">u</em><sup>2</sup>
on the surface, and the <em class="italic">n</em> / 3
molecules moving in the same direction will exert a force <em
class="italic">n</em> / 3 × <em class="italic">m</em> <em
class="italic">u</em><sup>2</sup> on the unit surface. This
represents, therefore, the pressure of such a gas, as calculated on
the basis of the assumptions of the kinetic theory. Now, when a gas
is so strongly compressed, that the bulk of the molecules is not
negligible in comparison with the total volume of the gas, the number
of impacts on unit surface in unit time becomes sensibly greater
than <em class="italic">n</em> / 3 × <em class="italic">u</em> / 2,
since the distance to be covered between successive blows on the
surface will be sensibly less than 2 cm., in a cube of unit volume.
If we imagine, for the sake of a rough illustration, that one-third
of the molecules in 1 c.c. are united into one spherical mass
(indicated by A in Fig. 7), moving upwards and downwards, it is
obvious that the distance covered between two successive blows on
a surface is not 2 cm., but that distance diminished by twice the
diameter of the sphere. For strongly compressed gases, the total
number of impacts on unit surface is therefore sensibly greater
than <em class="italic">n</em> / 3 × <em class="italic">u</em> / 2,
and the pressure is proportionately greater. According to van der
Waal's correction for this effect, <em class="italic">P</em> = <em
class="italic">n</em> / 3 × <em class="italic">m</em> <em
class="italic">u</em><sup>2</sup> / (1 − <em class="italic">b</em>),
where <em class="italic">b</em> represents the volume actually
occupied by the molecules in 1 c.c. of the gas.<a id="FNanchor_43_43"
href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<div id="i042" class="figleft">
<img src="images/i042.jpg" width="150" height="148" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><em class="smcap">Fig</em>. 7.</div>
</div>

<p>Now, for solute molecules, the "free space" of movement, as we
may call it, is, similarly, very considerably reduced by the presence
<a id="p031" class="xxpn">[p031]</a> of the solvent, and the reduction of this free space, as Nernst
has shown, will have the same effect on the pressure produced
against unit surface of the solvent by the bombardment of the
solvent by the solute, as the reduction of the free space has on the
gas pressure when a gas is strongly compressed. The resulting
pressure on unit surface of the solution must thus be increased,
from the pressure <em class="italic">P</em><sub>gas</sub>, which would be exerted by the solute
against the walls of a vessel, if it were present as a gas of the same
concentration, at the same temperature, to <em class="italic">P</em><sub>gas</sub> / (1 − <em class="italic">v</em>), where
<em class="italic">v</em> represents the real volume occupied by the solvent and (1 − <em class="italic">v</em>)
the <em class="italic">free space</em> for the solute molecules <em class="italic">in unit volume</em> of solution.<a id="FNanchor_44_44" href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a>
If osmotic pressure is the result of such a bombardment of the
solvent by the molecules of the solute, one might, therefore, expect
to find the osmotic pressure <em class="italic">very much greater</em> than the gas pressure
of the same substance in the same volume at the same temperature.
However, in all the <em class="italic">experimental determinations</em> (by means of semipermeable
membrane, vapor pressure, boiling-point and freezing-point
measurements) of the osmotic pressure as defined on p. <a href="#p010">10</a>,
this <em class="italic">corrective factor cancels</em> out again.<a id="FNanchor_45_45" href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> <em class="italic">According to the kinetic
theory</em>, the osmotic pressure of a substance in <em class="italic">dilute solution
should, consequently, be found by experiment to be equal to the
gas pressure which a gas, of the same molecular concentration,
would exert at the same temperature</em>.<a id="FNanchor_46_46" href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<p>We find thus that the significant coincidence between the osmotic
pressure of a substance in dilute solution, as defined and
measured according to van&#160;'t Hoff, and the gas pressure which the
substance would exert, if it were present as a gas in the same
volume and at the same temperature, is in agreement with the
fundamental assumptions of the kinetic theory. This theory,
consequently, gives us an adequate theoretical explanation of
<a id="p032" class="xxpn">[p032]</a> osmotic pressure, as it does of gas pressure. As van&#160;'t Hoff says,<a id="FNanchor_47_47" href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a>
"if the osmotic pressure follows Gay-Lussac's law and is proportional
to the absolute temperature, then, like gas pressure, it
will become zero at 0° absolute temperature and will vanish
when molecular movements come to rest. It is therefore natural
to look for the cause of osmotic pressure in kinetic phenomena
and not in attractions."<a id="FNanchor_48_48" href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p><em class="smcap">Of</em> the laws and hypotheses concerning gases, the one that is
perhaps of most importance to chemistry is Avogadro's hypothesis.
With the aid of this hypothesis, we are able to determine the
relative molecular weights<a id="FNanchor_49_51" href="#Footnote_49_51" class="fnanchor">49</a> of such elements and compounds as are
gases, or are volatile at higher temperatures. If equal volumes of
gases, under the same conditions of temperature and pressure,
contain the same number of molecules, then the weights of such
equal volumes also represent the relative weights of the molecules
composing the gases. As a standard, for expressing the relative
molecular weights in definite numbers, the molecular weight of
oxygen is taken by convention to be 32, and all other molecular
weights are expressed in terms of this standard. The density, or
weight of one liter of oxygen at 0° and 760 mm., is 1.429 grams,
and the <em class="italic">molecular weight expressed in grams (molar weight)</em> of
oxygen, 32 grams, occupies, therefore, 32 / 1.429, or 22.4 liters.
The weights of <em class="italic">this same volume</em>, 22.4 liters, of gases and vapors,
calculated for 0° and 760 mm. pressure,<a id="FNanchor_50_52" href="#Footnote_50_52" class="fnanchor">50</a> express then directly, in
terms of the oxygen standard, the relative molecular weights of
the elements or compounds forming the gases. The weights themselves
give us directly their gram-molecular or molar weights.</p>

<p>When molecular weights are determined in this way, with the
aid of Avogadro's hypothesis, results are obtained which agree
<a id="p034" class="xxpn">[p034]</a> perfectly with the chemical behavior of the compounds or elements
in question. The molecular weights of hydrogen chloride, water,
ammonia, and marsh gas, for instance, are found to be 36.5, 18,
17 and 16, respectively, corresponding to the formulæ<a id="FNanchor_51_53" href="#Footnote_51_53" class="fnanchor">51</a> HCl,
H<sub>2</sub>O, NH<sub>3</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>, and in confirmation of these results we find,
by methods used especially in organic chemistry, that these compounds
show a chemical behavior agreeing perfectly with the
presence of one, two, three and four hydrogen atoms, respectively,
in their molecules. Marsh gas, for instance, by treatment with
chlorine, yields a monochloride, CH<sub>3</sub>Cl, a dichloride, CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, a
trichloride (chloroform), CHCl<sub>3</sub>, and a tetrachloride, CCl<sub>4</sub>. Water,
by proper treatment, may be converted in successive stages into
alcohol, (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)OH, and then into ether, (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)O(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>), or into
sodium hydroxide, NaOH, and sodium oxide, Na<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p>It is this perfect agreement between the chemical behavior and the formulæ
(as based on these molecular weights and on the analysis of compounds),
which forms the strongest <em class="italic">experimental evidence</em> of the correctness
of the fundamental assumption of Avogadro's hypothesis. The agreement
has been shown to hold for innumerable compounds, even for those of
greatest complexity, and it was such agreement which finally led to the general
acceptance of the hypothesis. The experimental evidence of this nature
is so strong, so extensive and so completely corroborative of the hypothesis,
that many chemists, rather justly, consider the hypothesis to have been established
as a law, although the evidence is circumstantial rather than direct.</p></div>

<p>While the application of Avogadro's hypothesis thus gives
results agreeing well with the observed chemical behavior of very
many important compounds, observations have been made which,
at first sight, do not appear to agree with the requirements of the
hypothesis and which seem to raise a doubt as to the <em class="italic">universal
truth</em> of its fundamental assumption. Thus, if equal volumes of
hydrogen chloride and ammonia, of the same temperature and
pressure, are brought together, ammonium chloride is formed,
both gases being totally consumed. Since, according to the
hypothesis, equal volumes, under the conditions obtaining, contain
the same numbers of molecules, the formation of ammonium
chloride takes place according to the equation NH<sub>3</sub> + HCl → NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, and we should anticipate that the molecular weight of
<a id="p035" class="xxpn">[p035]</a> ammonium chloride would be 17 + 36.5 or 53.5. However, when
the molecular weight is determined by obtaining the weight of a
measured volume of ammonium chloride vapor, at a temperature
sufficiently high to vaporize the salt, and the observations are
reduced to standard conditions of temperature and pressure, 26.75
grams is found as the calculated weight of 22.4 liters, and this
weight, according to this hypothesis, should be the molecular
weight of the chloride. This contradiction in two conclusions,
each reached by the application of Avogadro's hypothesis to
experimental observations, would, at the first glance, make one
hesitate to accept the hypothesis as representing a universal
truth; it might seem as if in some gases, such as ammonium
chloride vapor, there might be only half as many molecules
in a given volume as in the same volume of the majority of
gases.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Gaseous Dissociation.</h4>—The discrepancy
between the two conclusions and any doubt as to the universal
soundness of the great generalization expressed in Avogadro's
hypothesis disappear, however, in the light of a closer
study of the composition of ammonium chloride vapor. It was
suggested simultaneously by Cannizzaro, by Kopp and by Kékulé<a
id="FNanchor_52_54" href="#Footnote_52_54" class="fnanchor">52</a>
that the abnormally low result, obtained for the molecular weight
of ammonium chloride from a study of its vapor density, is due
to the <em class="italic">dissociation</em> of the salt at high
temperatures into its components, ammonia and hydrogen chloride, the
<em class="italic">average</em> of whose <em class="italic">molecular
weights</em> is, in fact, (17 + 36.5) / 2, or 26.75, the value
found experimentally for the vapor of ammonium chloride. Proof of
the correctness of this interpretation was furnished by Pébal,<a
id="FNanchor_53_55" href="#Footnote_53_55" class="fnanchor">53</a>
who showed that ammonium chloride vapor does consist of the two
gases, the lighter of which, ammonia, diffuses more rapidly through
porous walls (Pébal used an asbestos stopper) than does the heavier,
hydrogen chloride. The dissociation may be easily demonstrated
by using an air cushion as a porous wall.<a id="FNanchor_54_56"
href="#Footnote_54_56" class="fnanchor">54</a> From the mixture
produced by vaporizing ammonium chloride,<a id="FNanchor_55_57"
href="#Footnote_55_57" class="fnanchor">55</a> the ammonia will
diffuse more rapidly through the layer of air than will the hydrogen
<a id="p036" class="xxpn">[p036]</a> chloride, and the gases may
be recognized in succession by their action on litmus paper (<em
class="italic">exp.</em>).</div>

<p>The <em class="italic">gaseous dissociation</em> of other ammonium salts, of phosphorus
pentachloride and pentabromide (PX<sub>5</sub> ⇄ PX<sub>3</sub> + X<sub>2</sub>), and
of a number of less common compounds, has been demonstrated
in similar ways. As a result of the study of each case, the important
conclusion has been reached that, as far as our knowledge
goes, there are no exceptions to Avogadro's hypothesis,
and this hypothesis seems therefore to represent a universal
truth.<a id="FNanchor_56_58" href="#Footnote_56_58" class="fnanchor">56</a></p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Molecular Weight Determinations in
Solution.</h4>—Van&#160;'t Hoff's extension of the Avogadro
Hypothesis, so that it shall apply to solutes in dilute solutions,
is the basis of another general method of greatest value for
determining molecular weights. Equal volumes of dilute solutions
of the same osmotic pressure and the same temperature contain,
according to van&#160;'t Hoff, the same numbers of dissolved
molecules, irrespective of the solvent used. Furthermore, the number
of dissolved molecules is identical with that which a gas of the
same pressure and at the same temperature would contain in the same
volume. To determine the molecular weight of a solute, therefore,
we may calculate, from the osmotic pressure, the temperature
and the concentration of the solution,<a id="FNanchor_57_59"
href="#Footnote_57_59" class="fnanchor">57</a> that weight of
the solute which, in 22.4 liters of the solution, at 0° would
give 760 mm. osmotic pressure; the weight found represents,
in grams, the <em class="italic">molecular weight</em> of the
solute <em class="italic">in the solution used</em>. <a id="p037"
class="xxpn">[p037]</a></div>

<p>The fact that <em class="italic">all solvents</em> and <em
class="italic">all solutes</em> are included in this hypothesis, with
the sole limiting condition that the solution must be dilute, is one
of great significance and of greatest practical importance, as we may
use any suitable solvent for determinations.</p>

<p>When molecular weights are determined in this way, a very large
number of compounds give the same molecular weight by the solution
method as by the gas method. For instance we have:</p>

<p>Further, the molecular weight of glucose is found in aqueous
solutions to be 180, conforming to the formula C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, and
agreeing with the molecular weight as obtained by a chemical
study of compounds derived from glucose.</p>

<p>While there are, then, very many agreements in the molecular
weights determined by the solution and by the older methods,
it was recognized, at the outset,<a id="FNanchor_58_60"
href="#Footnote_58_60" class="fnanchor">58</a> that there is also
a large number of apparently <em class="italic">abnormal</em> cases,
in which, in particular, <em class="italic">much lower molecular
weights</em> are obtained by the solution methods than by the gas
method,—lower even than the weights consistent with the accepted
atomic weights of the elements in the compounds in question.<a
id="FNanchor_59_61" href="#Footnote_59_61" class="fnanchor">59</a>
For instance, we find 36.5 to be the molecular weight of hydrogen
chloride in the gas form, but in <em class="italic">aqueous</em>
solution its apparent molecular weight, as determined on the basis
of van&#160;'t Hoff's hypothesis, is not even a constant; it is
found to be less than 36.5 and approaches the limit 18.25, the more
dilute the solution, <a id="p038" class="xxpn">[p038]</a> the
lower being the apparent molecular weight.<a id="FNanchor_60_62"
href="#Footnote_60_62" class="fnanchor">60</a> For sodium chloride,
the formula weight, corresponding to the formula NaCl, is 58.5. This
would also represent its smallest molecular weight in gas form,
consistent with the accepted atomic weights for sodium and chlorine.
In <em class="italic">aqueous</em> solution, again, the apparent
molecular weight of sodium chloride is found to be less than 58.5,
and more than 29.25, the value found depending on the concentration
of the solution used. For zinc chloride we have, likewise, in aqueous
solution values much less than 136 and tending toward the limit 45,
whereas the formula weight for ZnCl<sub>2</sub> is 136.</p>

<p>These are instances of a very large class of apparent gross
discrepancies between the requirements of the Avogadro-van&#160;'t
Hoff principle and the generally accepted molecular weights of
common compounds. There are three ways, in particular, in which one
might be inclined to regard such results: in the first place, one
might be tempted to consider that van&#160;'t Hoff's extension of
Avogadro's hypothesis to solutions is justified in a considerable
number of cases, but not as a <em class="italic">universal</em>
expression, applicable to <em class="italic">all</em> dilute
solutions. This seems, indeed, to have been van&#160;'t Hoff's own
attitude originally. Such a view, since it does not throw new light
on the matter, but simply shelves the question of the source of the
discrepancy, would be tenable only after all other explanations had
been found unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>In the second place, we might be inclined to consider whether
a molecule like hydrogen chloride is not dissociated in aqueous solution
into two smaller molecules, <em class="italic">h</em><em class="italic">cl</em>, in which hydrogen and chlorine
would appear as atoms with the weights <em class="italic">h</em> = 0.5 and <em class="italic">cl</em> = 17.75,
which are half as large as the atomic weights determined from a
study of volatile compounds of hydrogen and chlorine. If we remember
that our atomic weights are confessedly maximum weights,
and not minimum weights—although they are almost certainly
also the true atomic weights—such a view would be, at least,
worthy of some consideration. But, in the first place, it would be
extraordinary that we should never have found, in the thousands of
<a id="p039" class="xxpn">[p039]</a> hydrogen derivatives that have been investigated, any compound,
the molecule of which, in the gaseous condition, contained a <em class="italic">single</em>
such atom of hydrogen, with the weight 0.5, or an <em class="italic">uneven</em> multiple
of it: that only <em class="italic">even</em> multiples or pairs <em class="italic">h</em><sub>2</sub>, corresponding to the
atom H, should always have been found. In the second place,
such an explanation of the results of the molecular weight determinations
in aqueous solutions given above, would soon lead
to difficulties, which make the view altogether untenable. For
instance, the molecule of zinc chloride, according to the data
given, would have to break down into three molecules and, if
these were of uniform composition, we would have to assume
chlorine atoms two-thirds or one-third as large as Cl. Since a
moment ago we had to assume chlorine atoms one-half as large
as Cl, we would have to conclude that the atomic weight of chlorine
could be, at most, Cl / 6, which is the largest common divisor of
Cl / 2 and Cl / 3. No chemist would seriously consider an atomic
weight for chlorine one-sixth as large as the accepted weight, for
that would mean that, in all the chlorine compounds investigated
in the condition of gases, we have always at least six such atoms
occurring together, and otherwise always multiples of six. Consequently
such an interpretation of the so-called "abnormal" behavior
of solutions of hydrogen chloride, sodium and zinc chlorides,
etc., although at one time advanced by some chemists, must be
considered as altogether untenable.</p>

<p>A third explanation of the "abnormally" low molecular weights,
which certain substances in aqueous solutions possess, is, that
the molecules of these compounds are <em class="italic">capable of dissociation into
smaller molecules of unlike composition</em>, somewhat like ammonium
chloride when it is heated, and that the substances in question
are dissociated more or less considerably in this fashion in the
solutions under consideration. Hydrogen chloride, for instance,
besides existing as such (as HCl), in aqueous solutions, might be
capable of dissociating, and actually be dissociated, to a considerable
degree into molecules containing either only hydrogen or
only chlorine (HCl ⇄ H + Cl); the <em class="italic">average</em> of the weights of the
molecules in a mixture of molecules, HCl, H, and Cl, would be <em class="italic">less</em>
than 36.5, and, according to the proportion of dissociated and
undissociated molecules of hydrogen chloride, the average would
lie between the limits 36.5 and (1 + 35.5) / 2, or 18.25. Such an
<a id="p040" class="xxpn">[p040]</a> explanation,<a id="FNanchor_61_63" href="#Footnote_61_63" class="fnanchor">61</a> made with <em class="italic">certain additions and restrictions</em>, was
advanced in 1885 by Arrhenius, a Swedish chemist and physicist,
when he learned of the exceptional behavior of these solutions, as
noted by van&#160;'t Hoff. Although at first this interpretation occasioned
considerable criticism, it has maintained itself successfully
for twenty years, on the basis of a wide range of accumulated
facts, and it has been of remarkable value and benefit in the
development of all branches of chemistry and the allied sciences.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Theory of Ionization.</h4>—Arrhenius[2] made the simple
observation that all those solutions, in which the dissolved compounds
seem to have abnormally low molecular weights, are solutions
through which an <em class="italic">electric current</em> may be readily passed, they
are <em class="italic">electrolytes</em>, whereas the solutions which give normal results
(see, for instance, the table on p. <a href="#p037">37</a>) do not allow the ready
passage of a current, they are <em class="italic">nonelectrolytes</em>.</div>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p><em class="smcap">Exp.</em> The fundamental difference between the two classes of solutions
may readily be demonstrated. To water contained in an electrolytic cell,
which is connected with a lighting circuit and with an electric lamp, first
some alcohol, and later a small quantity of hydrochloric acid are added. The
lamp is seen to glow, instantly, when the acid is added.</p></div>

<p>This simple fact, that the very solutions which give abnormally
low molecular weights for the dissolved compounds are also good
conductors of electricity, was explained by a theory of <em class="italic">electrolytic
dissociation</em> or of <em class="italic">ionization</em>, which Arrhenius had developed<a id="FNanchor_62_64" href="#Footnote_62_64" class="fnanchor">62</a> from
a study of the conductivity of electrolytes. The same fact has
aided in establishing this theory which has led to the elucidation
of vital problems of <em class="italic">electrical conductivity</em> and to a successful
<a id="p041" class="xxpn">[p041]</a> explanation of the problem of the apparently abnormal <em class="italic">osmotic
pressures</em> (and <em class="italic">molecular weights</em>) of electrolyte solutes. It has
thus removed the last difficulty in the way of accepting the van&#160;'t
Hoff-Avogadro Hypothesis (p. <a href="#p015">15</a>) as true for all dilute solutions,
exactly as the discovery of <em class="italic">gaseous dissociation</em> made it possible to
recognize in the original Avogadro Hypothesis a universal truth
(p. <a href="#p036">36</a>) about gases. And to these results was added, chiefly as the
fruit of the work of Ostwald, with the aid of the theory of Arrhenius,
the most successful and accurate formulation of the problem of the
<em class="italic">chemical activity</em> of electrolytes, known in the history of chemistry.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Main Assumptions of Arrhenius's Theory of Ionization.</h4>—The
main assumptions of the theory of electrolytic dissociation
or ionization are the following: (1) When an ionogen is dissolved
in water, its molecules are immediately, more or less completely,
<em class="italic">dissociated by the water</em> into smaller fragments or molecules of
unlike composition. (2) These new molecules are charged with
<em class="italic">electricity</em>; the molecules of the one product are charged with
<em class="italic">positive</em>, the molecules of the other product<a id="FNanchor_63_65" href="#Footnote_63_65" class="fnanchor">63</a> with <em class="italic">negative electricity</em>,
the unit positive charge being equal in quantity, but
opposite in kind, to the unit negative charge; the sum of all the
positive charges in a solution is equal to the sum of all the negative
charges, and the whole solution is electrically neutral. (3) The
dissociation is a reversible reaction, and all electrolytes must be
considered to be <em class="italic">completely ionized at infinite dilution</em>. (4) Except
for the dependence resulting from the electrical charges and the
consequent attractions and repulsions between ions, the ions must
be considered independent molecules with their own <em class="italic">specific chemical</em>
and <em class="italic">physical</em> properties.</div>

<p>When a current is passed through the solution of an ionogen,
the electrified particles carry their charges to the electrodes (see
<a id="p042" class="xxpn">[p042]</a> below). They are called the <em class="italic">ions</em><a id="FNanchor_64_66" href="#Footnote_64_66" class="fnanchor">64</a> of the electrolyte; the positively
charged ions are distinguished as <em class="italic">cations</em> from the negatively
charged <em class="italic">anions</em>, and the electrode toward which the cations move
is called the cathode (negative electrode), and the electrode to
which the anions move is called the <em class="italic">anode</em> (positive electrode).</p>

<p>The dissociation of hydrogen chloride may be expressed, in the
terms of the assumptions made, in the following equation: <span
class="ibnowrap">HCl ⇄ H<sup>+</sup> + Cl<sup>−</sup>;</span> that
is, hydrogen chloride is dissociated, to a greater or smaller
extent and in reversible fashion, into positively charged hydrogen
ions <span class="ibnowrap">H<sup>+</sup>,</span> and negatively
charged chloride ions <span class="ibnowrap">Cl<sup>−</sup>,</span>
and the charge on each chloride ion is equal in quantity
to the positive charge on each hydrogen ion. Zinc
chloride is dissociated according to the equation <span
class="ibnowrap">ZnCl<sub>2</sub> ⇄ Zn<sup>2+</sup> + 2 Cl<sup>−</sup>,</span>
and, according to (2), the charge on each zinc ion is twice as great
in quantity as the charge on each chloride ion, and therefore twice
as great also as the charge on each hydrogen ion (see below, p.
<a href="#p058">58</a>). It is practically certain, according to more recent results,
that the ions are combined with water to form hydrates, such as
<span class="ibnowrap">H<sup>+</sup>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub><em
class="italic">x</em></sub></span> and <span
class="ibnowrap">Cl<sup>−</sup>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub><em
class="italic">y</em></sub>.<a id="FNanchor_65_67"
href="#Footnote_65_67" class="fnanchor">65</a></span> This does not
modify, essentially, the fundamental assumptions of the theory, but
contributes rather to a satisfactory explanation of the rôle of water
as an ionizing agent, a question to which we shall return later.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Theory of Ionization and the Electron Theory of Electricity
and of Matter.</h4><a id="FNanchor_66_68" href="#Footnote_66_68" class="fnanchor">66</a>—According to the views held by many
leading physicists at the present time, <em class="italic">negative electricity</em> consists of
ultimate particles of matter called electrons or corpuscles. The
mass of an electron is about 1 / 1000 the mass of an atom of hydrogen,
and the electric charge of the electron is equal to that carried
by a chloride ion in solution.<a id="FNanchor_67_69" href="#Footnote_67_69" class="fnanchor">67</a> The atoms of the elements are
considered to consist of aggregations of large numbers of electrons
in a kind of "shell" or "body" of positive electricity. This positive
electricity, in a given atom, is equal in quantity to the total
negative charge of the electrons in the atom, the atoms as such
<a id="p043" class="xxpn">[p043]</a> containing no excess of either positive or negative electricity.
The number of electrons in the atom of an element is considered to
be definite and constant for that element, but the number varies as
we go from the atoms of one element to those of a second element,
the number increasing with the atomic weight of the element.</div>

<p>One of the most fundamental and most characteristic properties of
elements is considered to be the <em class="italic">affinity which
their atoms show for electrons</em>; thus, the atoms of metals like
sodium and potassium, which are generally called "electropositive"
elements,<a id="FNanchor_68_70" href="#Footnote_68_70"
class="fnanchor">68</a> show an enormous tendency <em
class="italic">to lose one electron</em> each and to form positively
charged particles<a id="FNanchor_69_71" href="#Footnote_69_71"
class="fnanchor">69</a> <span class="ibnowrap">Na<sup>-ε</sup></span>
<span class="ibnowrap">(= Na<sup>+</sup>)</span> and K<sup>-ε</sup>
(= K<sup>+</sup>).<a id="FNanchor_70_72" href="#Footnote_70_72"
class="fnanchor">70</a> The atoms of strongly electronegative
elements, like chlorine, have a tremendous tendency for <em
class="italic">gaining</em> and <em class="italic">holding
electrons</em> beyond the number originally in such atoms. Thus,
chlorine atoms tend to <em class="italic">assume an electron</em>
each; they thereby become <em class="italic">negatively charged</em>
particles, <span class="ibnowrap">Cl<sup>+ε</sup></span> <span
class="ibnowrap">( = Cl<sup>−</sup>).</span></p>

<p>On the basis of these views, we have in sodium chloride NaCl a
substance, whose molecules contain an atom, Na, with a tremendous
<em class="italic">tendency to lose an electron</em>, and an
atom, Cl, which has a tremendous <em class="italic">affinity
for an electron</em>. It is natural to suppose, then, that <em
class="italic">both tendencies will be satisfied by the passage
of an electron from the sodium to the chlorine atom</em>,
NaCl → Na<sup>-ε</sup>Cl<sup>+ε</sup>. Or, if we use the sign + to
designate the positive charge produced on an atom by the loss of
an electron and the sign − to indicate the charge gained through
the assumption of an electron, we have<a id="FNanchor_71_73"
href="#Footnote_71_73" class="fnanchor">71</a>: NaCl is
<span class="ibnowrap">Na<sup>+</sup>Cl<sup>−</sup>.</span> Similarly we have in hydrogen chloride
<span class="ibnowrap">H<sup>-ε</sup>Cl<sup>+ε</sup></span> or
<span class="ibnowrap">H<sup>+</sup>Cl<sup>−</sup>.</span> It
is altogether likely, therefore, that the atoms in a molecule
of sodium chloride or of hydrogen chloride already possess
electric charges,<a id="FNanchor_72_74" href="#Footnote_72_74"
class="fnanchor">72</a> so that, even while combined, <a
id="p044" class="xxpn">[p044]</a> their tendencies to lose or gain
electrons are satisfied. It is also possible that the atoms are
held together in the molecule by the electrical attraction of the
opposite charges.<a id="FNanchor_73_75" href="#Footnote_73_75"
class="fnanchor">73</a> The force with which opposite electrical
charges attract each other depends, as is well known, on the nature
of the <em class="italic">surrounding medium</em>. Now, when
molecular sodium chloride or hydrogen chloride is dissolved in water
(a favorable medium), a decided decrease in the attraction (see
p. <a href="#p062">62</a>), between the charged atoms within the molecules is brought
about, and a process of <em class="italic">ionization</em> results:
<span class="ibnowrap">H<sup>+</sup>Cl<sup>−</sup> ⇄ H<sup>+</sup> + Cl<sup>−</sup>.</span>
The charged particles are called <em class="italic">ions</em>
only after they have separated from one another and have become
independent molecules, capable, for example, of moving in <em
class="italic">opposite</em> directions.</p>

<p>While the atoms of some metallic elements tend
to lose a single electron and form ions <span
class="ibnowrap">Me<sup>+</sup></span> (<em class="italic">e.g.</em>
<span class="ibnowrap">Na<sup>+</sup>,</span> <span
class="ibnowrap">K<sup>+</sup>),</span> the atoms of other elements
tend to lose two or more electrons, forming bivalent ions, <span
class="ibnowrap">Me<sup>2+</sup></span> (<em class="italic">e.g.</em>
<span class="ibnowrap">Zn<sup>2+</sup>,</span> <span
class="ibnowrap">Fe<sup>2+</sup>,</span> etc.), or trivalent
ions, <span class="ibnowrap">Me<sup>3+</sup></span>
(<em class="italic">e.g.</em> <span
class="ibnowrap">Bi<sup>3+</sup>,</span> <span
class="ibnowrap">Fe<sup>3+</sup>),</span> and so forth.
Similarly, atoms of the so-called negative elements may
assume two or more electrons, forming bivalent ions, <span
class="ibnowrap">X<sup>2−</sup></span> (<em class="italic">e.g.</em>
<span class="ibnowrap">S<sup>2−</sup>),</span> and so forth.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Validity of the Theory of
Ionization.</h4>—In determining the validity of the theory of
ionization, we may consider, first, the sufficiency of the
explanations which it offers for observed facts and important
phenomena. We may then weigh, more critically, by any evidence
offering itself, the facts which will enable us to decide between
this theory and the older theory of ionization, that of Clausius
(p. <a href="#p051">51</a>). The latter, although displaced, is still often revived
by opponents of the modern theory. Such facts as we will consider
are found, first, in the domain of <em class="italic">conductivity
phenomena</em>, next, in the <em class="italic">osmotic pressure</em>
and related properties of solutions, and, finally, in the study of
the <em class="italic">chemical activity</em> of electrolytes (see
Chapter V).</div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Ionization and Electrical
Conductivity.</h4>—Turning our attention first to the field of
electrical phenomena, and developing the theory for the present
descriptively, we find that the conductivity of a solution
depends, according to this theory, on the fact that when two
oppositely charged poles are placed in a solution, the <a id="p045"
class="xxpn">[p045]</a> positive charge on the anode attracts all
the negative particles within its field of action, and repels all
the positive particles, exactly as a positive static charge of
electricity would attract a negatively charged pith-ball and repel
a positively charged one. In the case of a solution of hydrochloric
acid, the negative charge on the cathode would attract the hydrogen
ions and repel the chloride ions, and the positive charge of the
anode would attract the chloride ions and repel the hydrogen
ions. The net result would be a migration of all the chloride
ions with their negative charges toward the anode, and of the
positively charged hydrogen ions toward the cathode,—a flow or <em
class="italic">current of electricity</em> being thus produced. The
fact, then, that a current of electricity does readily pass through
such a solution of an ionogen, is easily understood on the basis of
these views.</div>

<div id="i057" class="figright">
<img src="images/i057.jpg" width="250" height="391" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><em class="smcap">Fig. 8.</em></div>
</div>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p><em class="smcap">Exp.</em> The migration of the ions throughout
the whole solution may be demonstrated
by the passage of a current through a large
U-tube containing a mixture of a cupric salt
and a permanganate,<a id="FNanchor_74_76" href="#Footnote_74_76" class="fnanchor">74</a> placed under some dilute
sulphuric acid. The cupric-ion is blue, all
ionized solutions of cupric salts, with a colorless
negative ion, being blue, while the permanganate-ion
is of an intense purple color.
In the limb of the U-tube, in which the cathode
is placed, a blue zone, containing cupric ions,
is soon seen emerging from the purple liquid
and rising toward the cathode (see Fig. 8).
It will take some time for any cupric ions
actually to reach the electrode and be deposited
as metallic copper. On the anode
side, purple permanganate ions are seen rising
toward the positive electrode.</p></div>

<p>The movement of the electrically charged particles in opposite
directions through the solution constitutes an electric current,
and such a current has the properties of a current through a <a id="p046" class="xxpn">[p046]</a>
wire—producing,
for instance, heat, or being capable of deflecting a
magnet placed in its field of action.<a id="FNanchor_75_77" href="#Footnote_75_77" class="fnanchor">75</a></p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Electrolysis.</h4>—When ions touch an electrode, they are discharged,
and with the discharge, are changed chemically, and,
according to the electron theory, also materially. Cupric ions,
Cu<sup>2+</sup> or Cu<sup>−2 ε</sup>, receiving two electrons at the cathode, are precipitated
as metallic copper. When a current is passed through
a solution of hydrochloric acid, the hydrogen ions, by the pairing
of the discharged ions, yield hydrogen gas consisting of molecules,
H<sub>2</sub>; the chloride ions are converted at the anode into chlorine Cl<sub>2</sub>.
The formation of these molecules, X<sub>2</sub>, may be variously interpreted,
as resulting either from the union of two discharged or neutral
atoms, or as consisting, for instance in the case of hydrogen, in
the discharge of a hydrogen ion H<sup>+</sup>, at the negative electrode,
<em class="italic">followed by the assumption of a negative charge or electron by the
neutral atom</em>, the new ion H<sup>−</sup> combining at once with the positive
ion H<sup>+</sup> to form the molecule <span class="ibnowrap">H<sup>+</sup>H<sup>−</sup>.</span> At the positive pole, by
an analogous recharging of a discharged negative chloride-ion
<span class="ibnowrap">Cl<sup>−</sup>,</span> we should obtain a positive ion,<a id="FNanchor_76_78" href="#Footnote_76_78" class="fnanchor">76</a> Cl<sup>+</sup>, and immediately the
formation of Cl<sub>2</sub> or <span class="ibnowrap">Cl<sup>+</sup>Cl<sup>−</sup></span> would follow. Helmholtz advocated
the latter conception of the action at the electrodes, and, more
recently, J. J. Thomson<a id="FNanchor_77_79" href="#Footnote_77_79" class="fnanchor">77</a> brings forward, as a very important
argument in favor of it, the fact that iodine, which according to
vapor density determinations dissociates into monatomic molecules
at high temperatures <span class="ibnowrap">(I<sub>2</sub> ⇄ 2 I),</span> becomes, simultaneously
with this dissociation, also an excellent <em class="italic">gaseous conductor of electricity</em>,
as would be anticipated from a dissociation, <span class="ibnowrap">I<sup>+</sup>I<sup>−</sup> ⇄ I<sup>+</sup> + I<sup>−</sup>.</span>
This fact is emphasized here, because in it we seem to have a case
of <em class="italic">conductivity</em> coinciding with <em class="italic">gaseous dissociation</em>, the existence of
which is recognized by the universally accepted laws of gases, and
differing in no important respect from the dissociation assumed for
conductors in solution.</div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Conductivity and Dilution.</h4>—The passage of a current through
an electrolyte consists, then, in a transfer of electricity by material
particles, the ions. According to the theory of ionization only
<a id="p047" class="xxpn">[p047]</a> the ionized portion of an electrolyte can carry the current at any
moment, and, consequently, a <em class="italic">given weight</em> of an ionogen should,
under comparable conditions, be the more efficient as a conductor,
the more completely it is dissociated into ions.</div>

<p>If the conductivity of a given weight of hydrogen chloride, for
instance, is measured under comparable conditions, it should be
found to be greater, the more completely the acid is ionized.
Now, in aqueous solutions, hydrogen chloride ionizes under the influence
of the <em class="italic">solvent water</em> (pp. <a href="#p041">41</a>, <a href="#p061">61</a>), and the theory would lead
us to anticipate that the greater the proportion of water used,
the more extensively will it ionize the acid. Consequently, the
addition of water to a given weight of acid should increase the
latter's efficiency as a conductor. This conclusion has been fully
verified by exact methods of measurement and may be readily
demonstrated by the following series of experiments:</p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p><em class="smcap">Exp.</em><a id="FNanchor_78_80" href="#Footnote_78_80" class="fnanchor">78</a> An electrolytic cell, having the shape of a parallelopipedon and a
capacity of about one liter, is fitted with electrodes of copper, which reach
from the bottom to the top of the cell and are connected with a storage
cell and an ammeter. The cell is first filled with distilled water: no perceptible
current passes through the water and the latter is therefore practically
a nonconductor. The cell is then emptied by means of a siphon and 20 c.c. of
4-molar hydrochloric acid is brought into it. The ammeter shows that a
definite current passes through the solution (0.17 ampere in an experiment<a id="FNanchor_79_81" href="#Footnote_79_81" class="fnanchor">79</a>
with a cell 4.6 cm. wide and 11.5 cm. long, with copper electrodes 4.6 cm. broad
and 21 cm. high). (See Fig. 9, p. <a href="#p048">48</a>.) <a id="p048" class="xxpn">[p048]</a></p></div>

</div>

<p>The conductivity of a solution, like that of a metal conductor,
is the reciprocal of its resistance. Since, according to Ohm's
law,<a id="FNanchor_80_82" href="#Footnote_80_82" class="fnanchor">80</a> the current for a <em class="italic">given potential</em> is inversely proportional to
the resistance, the current is also directly proportional to the
conductivity. The resistances of the metal connections and of
the ammeter in the experiment are very small compared with the
resistance of the solution, and they may be considered negligible
for our purpose. Thus, <em class="italic">the current indicated by the ammeter is a
closely approximate measure of the conductivity of the solution</em>.
Now, if a volume of water (20 c.c.) equal to the volume of acid,
were to be added to the latter, the cross section through which
the current flows from plate to plate would be <em class="italic">doubled</em>, and, since
the conductivity of a liquid conductor, like that of a metal, increases
proportionally to the cross section, the current should be doubled
by the change in this one factor. On the other hand, the concentration
of the conducting acid is now <em class="italic">one-half</em> of the original
concentration, and this should in turn reduce the conductivity of
the solution to one-half. Consequently, if there were no further
change in the electrolyte, the original conductivity should be
maintained when the acid is thus diluted. But, according to
the theory of ionization, as has just been shown, the addition of
<a id="p049" class="xxpn">[p049]</a> water to a given weight of hydrochloric acid <em class="italic">should increase the
proportion of ionized acid</em>, and since the ions are the carriers of the
current, the <em class="italic">conductivity</em> of the solution should be <em class="italic">increased</em> because
of this change in the <em class="italic">composition</em> of the electrolyte. Experiment
shows that such is the case.</p>

<p><em class="smcap">Exp.</em> 20 c.c. of water is added to the 20 c.c. of 4-molar acid in the cell,

<p>We should expect, further, that the increase in conductivity,
being dependent on the increased dissociation of a finite quantity
of electrolyte, should tend towards a <em class="italic">limit</em>, a maximum conductivity
being reached when (practically) all the acid is ionized.
As a matter of experience, the conductivity of a given quantity
of an acid or other ionogen does tend toward a <em class="italic">limit</em>. In the
experiment just made, the conductivity of the acid increases very
rapidly at first, as the 4-molar acid is diluted by water; but the
increase in conductivity with the succeeding dilutions grows
<em class="italic">smaller</em> and <em class="italic">smaller</em> and the conductivity is plainly approaching
<a id="p050" class="xxpn">[p050]</a> a limit (see the ratios I and II in the table). For hydrochloric
acid at 18°, the limit for one mole<a id="FNanchor_81_83" href="#Footnote_81_83" class="fnanchor">81</a> (36.5 grams HCl) at infinite
dilution, as deduced from the curve of conductivities at finite

<div class="h4p"><h4>Degree of Ionization of an Electrolyte.</h4>—The conductivity of
a given weight of an electrolyte, for instance of its gram-equivalent
weight, depends, then, at a given temperature on the extent
to which it is ionized, the ions being the only carriers of the current
in a solution of an electrolyte. The conductivity will also depend
on the friction which the ions must overcome in moving through
a solution, but, for sufficiently dilute solutions in a given solvent,
the friction may be assumed to be approximately constant for
given ions. For such solutions, then, the conductivity of a given
weight of a given electrolyte at a given temperature may be said
to depend wholly on the extent to which the electrolyte is ionized.
Thus, the proportion of ionized electrolyte in a solution may be
determined by measuring the conductivity. <em class="italic">The extreme limit of
its conductivity, calculated for infinite dilution, represents complete
ionization</em> of the electrolyte according to a fundamental postulate
(§ 3, p. <a href="#p041">41</a>) of the theory of Arrhenius, and the ratio of the conductivity
in a given solution to the conductivity of the same
weight of electrolyte at infinite dilution represents then the <em class="italic">proportion
of ionized electrolyte to the total electrolyte</em> used. This
proportion is called its <em class="italic">degree of ionization</em> (commonly designated
by α). If we call Λ<sub><em class="italic">v</em></sub> the conductivity of a gram-equivalent weight
of an electrolyte in a given solution, and Λ<sub>∞</sub> the limit of its conductivity
for infinite dilution, then the degree of ionization is found
from α = Λ<sub><em class="italic">v</em></sub> / Λ<sub>∞</sub>. <a id="p051" class="xxpn">[p051]</a></div>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p>The method of calculation of α in a specific case may be illustrated as
follows: the resistance of a cube of 1 cm. edge of a solution of hydrochloric
acid, which contains 1.825 grams hydrogen chloride in a liter, is found to be
55.55 ohms at 18°. Its conductivity then is 1 / 55.55 reciprocal ohms. Now,
1.825 grams of hydrogen chloride is 1.825 / 36.5 or 1 / 20 gram-equivalent of
the acid; a whole gram-equivalent of the acid would be contained in 20 liters
or 20,000 c.c. Then Λ<sub><em class="italic">v</em></sub> = (1 / 55.55) × 20,000, or 360 reciprocal ohms. If
we use the value at infinite dilution given above, α = 360 / 384, or 93.75%.
That is, 93.75% of the hydrochloric acid is present in the ionized condition in
such a solution, and 6.25% is not ionized.</p></div>

<p>By making the assumption that <em class="italic">at infinite dilution electrolytes
are completely ionized</em>, and by taking the ratio which the equivalent
conductivity of a given solution of an electrolyte bears to the
maximum limit-value (calculated for the conductivity at infinite
dilution) <em class="italic">to be the degree of ionization of the electrolyte</em>, as just explained,
the theory of Arrhenius has thus made it appear possible <em class="italic">to
determine experimentally the proportion of ionized electrolyte present</em>.</p>

<p>It is a significant fact that the equivalent conductivity of
hydrochloric acid is <em class="italic">close to its limit even at finite dilutions</em>, and
that the same relation holds for the strong acids and the strong
bases, in general, and for most salts. But the equivalent conductivity
of weak acids, like acetic acid, and of weak bases, like
ammonium hydroxide, in finite dilutions is still far removed from
the limits which may be calculated for infinite dilutions. Arrhenius
was led then to the further important conclusion that, in the
case of the first electrolytes mentioned, a <em class="italic">very large proportion of
the electrolyte must exist in the ionized form at finite concentrations</em>,
their equivalent conductivities having almost reached the limit
characteristic of infinite dilution.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Clausius's Theory of Ionization and the Modern Theory.</h4>—It
is in these conclusions—in particular that the proportion of
ionized electrolyte <em class="italic">may be determined experimentally</em>, and that frequently
a <em class="italic">large proportion is found to be ionized at finite concentrations</em>,—that
the <em class="italic">modern theory of ionization differs from the older
theory of Clausius</em>. The former is an elaboration of the latter, and
some opponents<a id="FNanchor_83_85" href="#Footnote_83_85" class="fnanchor">83</a> of the modern theory still uphold the latter as
offering an adequate explanation of the phenomena of conductivity.
All facts, then, in particular, which confirm the validity of the
<em class="italic">conception of the degree of ionization</em>, as introduced by Arrhenius,
<a id="p052" class="xxpn">[p052]</a> must be considered as criteria favoring his theory, specifically. The
development of chemistry in the last twenty years is replete with
such evidence and we shall meet it in many connections throughout
our work.</div>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p>Clausius<a id="FNanchor_84_86" href="#Footnote_84_86" class="fnanchor">84</a> also assumed dissociated molecules or ions to be the real carriers
of electricity in the passage of a current through the solution of an electrolyte,
but he assumed only a <em class="italic">minute quantity of these molecular fragments or
ions to be free at any moment</em>, their existence being supposed to be transitory
and dependent in particular on exchanges of atoms between molecules. As
a result of the oscillations of the atoms composing a molecule, oscillations comparable
with the motions of molecules assumed in the kinetic theory of gases,
molecules were considered by Clausius occasionally to reach such a condition of
instability, that they dissociated into smaller particles; since the atoms were
supposed to be held in a molecule by attractions of electrical charges on the
atoms (theory of Berzelius), the fragments of the molecule would carry
the charges, positive and negative respectively, which they possessed in
the molecule. Such a breaking up or dissociation of molecules was, further,
supposed to occur with particular ease during the collisions of molecules, the
electrical attractions and repulsions of the charged atoms favoring, at such
moments, an <em class="italic">exchange of atoms</em>. During the exchange, the atoms were considered
to be free molecules, charged with electricity—essentially ions,—capable
of moving under the influence of electrical forces and of thus carrying
a current. Finally, such ions were supposed, in part, to escape recombination,
and to remain free, until each ion either collided and combined with an
ion of opposite charge, or collided with a molecule and displaced an atom of the
same charge from that molecule, a new ion being thus liberated. The theory,
as usually interpreted, assumed the existence of only a very small quantity of
such free ions, that being all that was supposed to be required to explain the
facts known at the time it was advanced.</p>

<p>In what follows, we shall confine the discussion strictly to such contrasts
between the two theories as grow out of a consideration of the phenomena of
conductivity, and particularly consider some evidence which is directly concerned
with the conductivity of solutions.</p>

<p>In the first place, if the formation of ions occurs primarily during the
exchange of atoms in <em class="italic">collisions of molecules</em>, then, as Whetham<a id="FNanchor_85_87" href="#Footnote_85_87" class="fnanchor">85</a> has shown, the
specific conductivity (of 1 cm.<sup>3</sup>) of an electrolyte, like hydrochloric acid, must
increase with the concentration and must increase, approximately, as a function
of the <em class="italic">third</em> power of the concentration. The more concentrated the solution,
the more frequent the collisions between the dissolved molecules must
be. As a matter of fact, as shown in the following table, the conductivity
<a id="p053" class="xxpn">[p053]</a> increases a <em class="italic">little less</em> than proportionally to the <em class="italic">first</em> power of the concentration—<em class="italic">which
is in conflict with the assumption made in the hypothesis of Clausius</em>,
but in perfect agreement with the hypothesis of Arrhenius. The small
<em class="italic">decrease</em> with increasing concentration, in the simple ratio between conductivity
and concentration, is due to the decreasing degree of ionization in the more
concentrated solutions, as demanded by the hypothesis of Arrhenius.</p>

<p>The table gives, in the first column, the specific conductivities of hydrochloric
acid at 18°, and, in the second column, the concentrations; these concentrations
are expressed in moles or gram-equivalents per cubic centimeter; the last
column gives the ratio of conductivity to concentration.</p>

<p>Furthermore, facts admitted by Clausius to be inexplicable by his own
assumptions receive, in the theory of Arrhenius, at least a quantitative formulation
borne out by a mass of corroborative evidence. The difference in conductivity
between pure water and sulphuric acid is such a fact, mentioned by
Clausius. Determinations of the ionization of sulphuric acid and of water,
by the conductivity methods which are based on the theory of Arrhenius, show
that, while sulphuric acid is very considerably ionized (see p. <a href="#p104">104</a>), water
is scarcely ionized at all. The ionization of water (see p. <a href="#p104">104</a>) has been determined
quantitatively by at least four independent methods of examination,<a id="FNanchor_86_88" href="#Footnote_86_88" class="fnanchor">86</a>
and, minimal as the ionization is, the results agree so well with each
other that van&#160;'t Hoff<a id="FNanchor_87_89" href="#Footnote_87_89" class="fnanchor">87</a> was led to write: "If one is not previously convinced of
the correctness of the theory of electrolytic dissociation, hardly any result
won by means of it is so convincing, as the agreement between the conclusions
reached in completely different ways as to the degree of dissociation of
water itself. After such an agreement, it is hardly conceivable that the
basis on which all these results rest should further be altered."</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Mobilities or Partial Conductivities of Ions: Principle of Kohlrausch.</h4>—If
ions have a separate existence, each kind of ion would be expected to move
through a solution under a given electrical force at a given temperature with
its own specific speed, the speed being presumably dependent on the nature
of the ion as well as on the weight of water combined with it and dragged
with it through the solution (p. <a href="#p042">42</a>). <a id="p054" class="xxpn">[p054]</a></div>

<p>Such relative speeds of ions may be demonstrated by means of an experiment:
the motion of the hydrogen ions, formed by the ionization of
hydrochloric and other acids, may be observed by their action on a reddened
(alkaline) solution of phenolphthaleïn, which is decolorized by them; and the
motion of the hydroxide ions, formed by the ionization of sodium hydroxide
and other bases, may be followed by their action on colorless phenolphthaleïn,
which turns red in their presence. The hydrogen and the hydroxide ions are
the fastest, in aqueous solutions, and their speeds are compared in the next experiment
with that of blue cupric ions, which have a speed roughly the same
as that of many common ions. In this experiment the hydrogen ions are
readily seen to move about twice as fast as the hydroxide ions and five to six
times as fast as the cupric ions.</p>

</div>

<p><em class="smcap">Exp.</em><a id="FNanchor_88_90" href="#Footnote_88_90" class="fnanchor">88</a> Five grams of agar-agar are dissolved in 250
c.c. of boiling water. To 100 c.c. of the hot solution, 32 c.c.
of a saturated solution of potassium chloride and about 1 c.c.
of phenolphthaleïn solution are added, together with enough of a
solution of potassium hydroxide, added drop by drop, to produce a
deep red tint in the phenolphthaleïn. Of this mixture 50 c.c. is
treated with dilute hydrochloric acid, added drop by drop, until the
red color is just discharged, and then an excess of acid, equal in
amount to the quantity used to neutralize the 50 c.c., is added to
the mixture. This colorless solution and 50 c.c. of the red solution
are poured, while still warm, into the two parts of a wide U-tube,
slowly and at equal rates, so that the level on the two sides remains
the same. In this way it is possible without difficulty to have the
solution on one side red (alkaline) and on the other side colorless
(acid). The agar-agar is allowed to congeal, and then a mixture of
0.5 c.c. of hydrochloric acid, (sp. g. 1.12), 6 c.c. of saturated
cupric chloride solution and 20 c.c. of water is poured over the
red half, and a mixture of 20 c.c. of saturated <a id="p055" class="xxpn">[p055]</a> potassium
chloride solution and 2 c.c. of 10% potassium hydroxide solution is
poured over the colorless half. The U-tube is surrounded by ice water
during the passage of the current, and the cathode is placed in the
solution on the colorless side. In Fig. 10 the ∪-tube is shown when
first charged (on the left), and after the current has been running
for a short time (on the right).</p>

<p>The conductivity of a solution must be made up, therefore, of the sum of
the shares which the positive ions and the negative ions, respectively, take in
carrying the current. This principle was first advanced by Kohlrausch. The
share of each kind of ion in conducting a current may be determined, for hydrochloric
acid for instance, in the following way: A porous diaphragm may
be used to divide the solution in an electrolytic cell into two halves, the
concentration of the acid being the same in both halves (represented, as
indicated in Fig. 11, by 15 molecules<a id="FNanchor_89_91" href="#Footnote_89_91" class="fnanchor">89</a> of ionized acid in each half). A
measured current is passed through the solution, say, sufficient to liberate
3 molecules of hydrogen H<sub>2</sub>, and 3 of chlorine Cl<sub>2</sub>, corresponding to 6 <em class="italic">ions</em>
of each, and the concentration of the acid in each half is then again determined
by analysis. Say it is found to correspond to 14 molecules of hydrochloric
acid in the half of the solution on the side of the cathode and 10
molecules in the half on the side of the anode (see Fig. 12). Then the anode
half has lost 5 ions of hydrogen, which must have passed through the
diaphragm toward the cathode and taken the place of five of the six hydrogen
ions discharged at the cathode. Similarly, the solution around the cathode
has lost one chloride ion, which must have passed through the diaphragm
toward the anode, and the hydrogen-ion corresponding to it, remaining on
the right side without a compensating negative ion, must be the sixth hydrogen-ion
discharged at the cathode. In other words, five hydrogen ions
passed to the right, while one chloride ion passed to the left. The hydrogen
ions then carried five-sixths of the current through the diaphragm, and
consequently through the solution, and the chloride ions only one-sixth of
the current. Since the solutions were of equal concentration to start with,
the hydrogen ions have moved <em class="italic">five times as fast</em> toward the cathode as the
chloride ions have moved toward the anode.</p>

<p>The equivalent conductivity of 0.1-molar hydrochloric acid is 351 at 18°,
and experiment shows that the hydrogen-ion carries 84% of the current, the
chloride-ion only 16%. The conductivity may then be considered to be the
<a id="p056" class="xxpn">[p056]</a> sum of the share the hydrogen-ion has in carrying the current, <em class="italic">i.e.</em> 0.84 × 351,
or 295, and of the share of the chloride-ion, 0.16 × 352.5, or 56. These values
may be called the <em class="italic">equivalent partial conductivities</em> or <em class="italic">mobilities</em> of the ions in
this solution.</p>

<p>In a similar way, the conductivity of every solution of an
electrolyte may be shown to represent the sum of the mobilities
of the ions carrying the current (<em class="italic">principle
of Kohlrausch</em>). The limit of the conductivity of one
equivalent of an electrolyte is the sum of the mobilities of
the ions composing the electrolyte. The frictional forces being
constant for infinitely dilute solutions, at a given temperature,
an ion will always show the same mobility, irrespective of
the nature of the ion of opposite charge, with which it
forms the electrolyte. We may then put <span class="ibnowrap">Λ<sub>∞</sub> = (<em

<p>For quite dilute solutions, in which the friction may be
assumed to be approximately constant, the conductivity will
depend, not only on the mobilities of the ions, which may be
taken to be the same as for solutions of extreme dilution, but
also <em class="italic">on the proportion of electrolyte that

<p>Now, Kohlrausch discovered the principle of the summation of the mobilities
of ions a number of years before the theory of Arrhenius was advanced,
and the proportion in which the ion is present in a given solution being
unknown, the effect of what is here known as the degree of ionization was
included empirically in the value of the mobility. It is not surprising, then,
that an ion was found to have approximately the same mobility <em class="italic">only</em> in
solutions of the same concentration <em class="italic">of strictly analogous and closely related
salts</em>, which, according to present methods of investigation, are <em class="italic">now</em> found
to have approximately the same degree of ionization. For instance, the
mobility of the gram-equivalent of the chloride-ion was found to be approximately
the same, 47.3 and 50.5 respectively, in molar solutions of sodium and
potassium chloride at 18°, no account being taken of the degrees of ionization.
However, the degrees of ionization of the two salts are approximately
the same, 66.9% and 74.9% respectively, and might be ignored in a comparison
of the conductivities, without affecting the result of the comparison
in any marked way. <a id="p057" class="xxpn">[p057]</a></p>

<p>When the conductivities of unlike electrolytes are compared, the
<em class="italic">introduction of the conception of the degree
of ionization</em> (by Arrhenius,) into Kohlrausch's principle
of the independent conductivities of specific ions, shows most
striking results and <em class="italic">demonstrates the value of
the new conception</em>. For instance, the equivalent conductivity
of potassium chloride at 18° in 0.075 molar solution is 113.8
reciprocal ohms and the partial conductivity of the chloride-ion
in the solution is 57.4. But the conductivity of an equivalent
solution of <em class="italic">mercuric chloride</em> at 18°
is only 1.51, which is very much less than the conductivity of
the chloride-ion alone in the potassium chloride solution. Now,
mercuric chloride, according to investigations of its conductivities
and of its effect in depressing the freezing-point of water,<a
id="FNanchor_91_93" href="#Footnote_91_93" class="fnanchor">91</a>
is one of a very few salts that are difficultly ionizable (p.
<a href="#p107">107</a>); according to the data mentioned, it is ionized, at most, to
the extent of 2.5 per cent in the solution in question, whereas
87.5 per cent of the potassium chloride is ionized in such a
solution. When the difference in the degree of ionization is
taken into account, the conductivity which mercuric chloride
<em class="italic">should show</em> may be calculated, <em
class="italic">on the assumption that the chloride-ion has the same
mobility</em> in the two solutions, but that there is less of it in
the mercuric solutions. We put <span class="ibnowrap">Λ<sub>HgCl<sub>2</sub></sub> = α (<em
class="italic">l</em><sub>Hg</sub> + <em
class="italic">l</em><sub>Cl</sub>) = 0.025&#8201;(48 + 65.9) = 2.8.</span> We
thus find that the conductivity of the mercuric chloride should be,
approximately, only 2.8 reciprocal ohms, which is of the same order
as that found (1.51).<a id="FNanchor_92_94" href="#Footnote_92_94"
class="fnanchor">92</a></p>

<p>In the same way, when we compare the conductivity of a strong acid, like
hydrochloric acid, with that of a weak acid, like acetic acid—the conductivity
of 0.1 molar hydrochloric acid is 351, of 0.1 molar acetic acid only
4.6—the principle of the specific, characteristic mobility of the hydrogen-ion,
which is present in both solutions, has significance only if we take into
account the very different concentrations of the hydrogen-ion in the two
solutions, <em class="italic">resulting from the different degrees of ionization of the two acids</em>—91%
for the hydrochloric and only 1.7% for the acetic acid. The same
relations hold in the comparison of the conductivity of a solution of a
strong base like sodium hydroxide with that of an equivalent solution of
a weak, i.e. much less ionized base like ammonium hydroxide, or in comparing
the conductivity of a <em class="italic">weak acid</em> or a <em class="italic">weak base</em> with the conductivities of
their <em class="italic">much more highly ionized salts</em>.</p>

<p><em class="italic">In all these cases the use of the conception of the degree of ionization of the
electrolytes</em> makes possible a much broader and more general application of the
principle of the independent migration or mobility of the ions than was possible
before the theory of Arrhenius was proposed, and marks a distinct
advance in the theory of conductivity, over what was possible on the basis of
the theory of Clausius. <a id="p058" class="xxpn">[p058]</a></p></div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Faraday's Law.</h4>—If a definite quantity of electricity, a
faraday,<a id="FNanchor_93_95" href="#Footnote_93_95" class="fnanchor">93</a> or 96,600 coulombs, is passed through a solution of
hydrochloric acid, a definite quantity (36.5 grams, one mole) of
the hydrogen chloride is decomposed, and one gram of hydrogen
and 35.5 grams of chlorine are liberated by the discharge of one
gram (<em class="italic">i.e.</em> one gram-ion) of the hydrogen-ion and 35.5 grams or
one gram-ion of the chloride-ion. In a solution of cupric chloride,
the chloride-ion is identical in every respect with the chloride-ion
found in a solution of hydrochloric acid. In the solution of
cupric chloride, however, a molecule of the salt, when it is completely
ionized, produces two chloride ions for every cupric ion
<span class="ibnowrap">(CuCl<sub>2</sub> ⇄ Cu<sup>2+</sup> + 2 Cl<sup>−</sup>).</span> Since the solution never shows the
presence of an excess of either form of electricity, and the negative
charge on each chloride ion is the same as on a chloride
ion formed by the dissociation of hydrogen chloride, a cupric ion
must hold <em class="italic">exactly</em> double the positive charge that a hydrogen ion
does. In modern terms, each hydrogen atom, present as an ion,
has lost one electron, and each copper atom present in the form of
a cupric ion has lost two electrons. Our unit quantity of electricity,
96,600 coulombs, can discharge therefore <em class="italic">only half as many
of the cupric</em> as of the hydrogen ions, and since each cupric ion
is 63.6 times as heavy as the hydrogen-ion (Cu = 63.6, H = 1),
63.6 / 2 grams of copper, the <em class="italic">equivalent weight</em>, will be deposited in
place of one gram of hydrogen. Similarly, from a solution of ferrous
chloride FeCl<sub>2</sub>, 55.9 / 2 grams of iron (Fe = 55.9) will be deposited,
the ferrous ion being Fe<sup>2+</sup>; while from a solution of ferric
chloride FeCl<sub>3</sub>, only <span class="ibnowrap">55.9 / 3</span> grams of iron will be deposited by
96,600 coulombs, the ferric ion, Fe<sup>3+</sup>, holding three times the
charge that a hydrogen ion does. In other words, a given quantity
of current will decompose <em class="italic">equivalent</em> quantities of electrolytes and
deposit <em class="italic">equivalent quantities</em> of metals. This is the well-known
law of Faraday. The theory of Arrhenius agrees with it, as did
the theory of Clausius. It cannot be considered as evidence
bearing on the question of the preference to be given to either
of the theories of ionization, since the degree of ionization of electrolytes
is not involved in the relations covered by the law. But
any other relation would have been incompatible with the theory
of Arrhenius. The law is of particular importance in giving us
<a id="p059" class="xxpn">[p059]</a> the best clew that we have in regard to the ultimate nature of
"valence" (as shown for instance in the difference between the
ferrous, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, and the ferric ions, Fe<sup>3+</sup>). On the basis of this
law, valence may be said to consist simply in the capacity of atoms
to hold different multiples of the unit electrical charge (positive
or negative). This conception will be of especial value to us
when we come to consider the relation of the theory of ionization
to oxidation and reduction (Chapters XIV and XV).</div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Diffusion of Ions and Concentration Cells.</h4>—When the, apparently,
abnormally low molecular weight of ammonium chloride
was explained as being due to the dissociation of each molecule
of ammonium chloride into a molecule of ammonia and one of
hydrogen chloride, the evidence of the correctness of this interpretation
was at once forthcoming—the vapor of ammonium chloride,
by the unequal rates of diffusion of its components, was proved
to be a mixture of the two gases (p. <a href="#p035">35</a>). Now, if an electrolyte
like hydrochloric acid in aqueous solution is dissociated more or
less into separate ions, H<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>−</sup>, then one may well ask, whether
the dissociation cannot be demonstrated by the same kind of
experiment, as, for instance, by showing that hydrogen and
chloride ions <em class="italic">are molecules with unequal powers of diffusion</em> and <em class="italic">by
separating them by virtue of such inequality</em>. Ions being, according
to the theory under consideration, independent molecules, except
for the attractive and repulsive forces of the electrical charges,
they should have, like cane sugar, copper nitrate and other solutes,
the capacity for diffusion from regions of higher to those of lower
concentration. Further, if ions show different degrees of mobility
(p. <a href="#p053">53</a>), one would expect the more mobile or faster moving one
to diffuse more rapidly than a less mobile ion. Such a relation
should hold for the ions in a solution of hydrochloric acid, the
hydrogen-ion, according to the calculations of Kohlrausch<a id="FNanchor_94_96" href="#Footnote_94_96" class="fnanchor">94</a> and the
observation of Lodge,<a id="FNanchor_95_97" href="#Footnote_95_97" class="fnanchor">95</a> moving at a rate about five times as great
as that of the chloride-ion, at 18°. Thus, if a rather concentrated
solution of hydrochloric acid were covered with a layer of
water, or with a very dilute solution of the acid, one might expect
the hydrogen ions to migrate faster than the chloride ions from the
<a id="p060" class="xxpn">[p060]</a> point of higher to that of lower concentration, <em class="italic">i.e.</em> from the more
concentrated to the dilute acid. When the experiment is tried
in this way, no separation of the hydrogen from the chloride ions
seems to occur. The reason for the failure of the experiment is
as follows: If any such separation did occur, even to the extent
of say one milligram-equivalent of hydrogen and chloride ions, we
would have a separation of electrostatic charges of 96 coulombs.
These charges, on the small areas involved, would inevitably produce
enormous potentials, that would operate against the separation.
The hydrogen ions, which would tend to move from the
concentrated to the dilute acid, would therefore be held back by
the powerful attraction between their positive charges and the
negative charges left in the concentrated acid (on the Cl<sup>−</sup> ions).
The separation of the electrical charges, incidental to a faster
diffusion of hydrogen ions, if it occurred, would result, therefore,
in the development of electrical forces of attraction, which
would prevent a separation of the oppositely charged particles
beyond any but distances too small to be measured. It would
follow, however, that no difficulty whatever should be experienced
in <em class="italic">observing such a separation</em>, as a result of unequal rates of migration
of the ions in question, <em class="italic">if provision were made to preserve electrical
neutrality in all zones</em> of the two solutions, <em class="italic">i.e.</em> if provision is
made for the immediate discharge of the ions, as they separate by
the unequal rates of diffusion. For instance, the part of the liquid
into which the positive hydrogen ions move more rapidly, charging
it with positive electricity, may be connected, by means of a
wire, with the part of the liquid to which the chloride ions, left
behind by their slower movements, are imparting a negative
charge. In such a circuit, a current of electricity should be produced,
the positive current flowing through the wire from the
dilute to the concentrated acid. As a matter of fact, we find
that a current is produced, when these conditions are observed.</div>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p><em class="smcap">Exp.</em> The lower plate in an Arrhenius cell is covered with concentrated
hydrochloric acid. Very dilute acid is allowed to flow slowly on to the surface
of the concentrated acid, from a pipette with a curved, narrow point, until the
upper plate is submerged. The two plates are connected with a sensitive galvanometer.
The current flows in the direction demanded by the observed
mobilities of the ions, the positive current entering the galvanometer from the
plate covered by the dilute solution, which is charged positively by the faster
moving hydrogen ions coming from the concentrated solution. If the cell is
<a id="p061" class="xxpn">[p061]</a> connected with the electrodes of a very small cell containing copper sulphate,
in the course of twenty-four hours quite a deposit of metallic copper is formed
on the electrode connected with the concentrated solution of hydrochloric
acid.</p></div>

<p>The existence of the products of the electrolytic dissociation,
of hydrochloric acid may therefore be demonstrated,<a id="FNanchor_96_98" href="#Footnote_96_98" class="fnanchor">96</a> by the
aid of the individual diffusion of the products of the dissociation,
in the same way as was the coëxistence of the products of the
gaseous dissociation of ammonium chloride, when the conditions
for the experiment are adapted to the nature of the dissociation
products. Cells of this type, depending for their current
on unequal concentrations of given ions, are called "concentration
cells."</p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p>If it can be shown that the flow of electricity, resulting from such unequal
diffusibility of ions, is a function not only of the difference in the total concentration
of the electrolyte in the two solutions brought into contact with each
other, but is also a function of the relative degrees of ionization of the electrolyte
in the two solutions, as defined by the theory of Arrhenius, then
this method of experimentation may be used as a further test of the validity
of this theory as against that of Clausius. It is obvious that if such currents
are the results of the diffusion of <em class="italic">ions</em> from higher to lower concentrations,
then the essential concentrations do not embrace all of the electrolyte,
but only the ionized part. W. K. Lewis<a id="FNanchor_97_99" href="#Footnote_97_99" class="fnanchor">97</a> has rather recently shown that the
degrees of dissociation of electrolytes may be measured by the use of concentration
cells, and that the results agree well with the determinations of
the degree of dissociation from conductivity measurements (p. <a href="#p050">50</a>). From
calculations, based on Jahn's accurate measurements of the electromotive
forces of concentration cells, A. A. Noyes<a id="FNanchor_98_100" href="#Footnote_98_100" class="fnanchor">98</a> finds that "when the conductivity
ratio is assumed to represent the degree of ionization of the salt, the calculated
values of the electromotive force of concentration cells exceed the
measured ones by only about one per cent, in the case of potassium and
sodium chloride between the concentrations of
<span class="ibnowrap">1 / 600</span> and <span class="ibnowrap">1 / 20 molar."</span></p></div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Rôle of the Solvent in Ionization.</h4>—A question that has
profoundly interested chemists, particularly during the last few
years, has been that of the rôle which the solvent plays in the
<a id="p062" class="xxpn">[p062]</a> dissociation of electrolytes into ions. The most important ionizing
solvent is water and, of the common solvents which cause ionization,
it is the most powerful in this particular. Alcohols have also
ionizing power; methyl or wood alcohol, which stands nearest to
water, has a higher ionizing power than ordinary ethyl alcohol.
The exact work<a id="FNanchor_99_101" href="#Footnote_99_101" class="fnanchor">99</a> of Franklin and Kraus, on the conductivity of
solutions of salts in liquid ammonia, showed that the same general
relations obtain for such solutions as for solutions in water, the
differences being differences of degree rather than of kind. Salts
are found to be less ionized in liquid ammonia than in equivalent
aqueous solutions, but their conductivities are higher, the result of
smaller friction in ammonia. Liquid hydrogen cyanide is also a
very good ionizing medium.</div>

<p>Solvents which cause ionization only to a minimal extent are
benzene (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>), carbon bisulphide, ether, chloroform, petroleum
ether (gasoline) and similar solvents. Hydrogen chloride dissolved
in benzene has an extremely small conductivity, indicating
only a trace of ionization.<a id="FNanchor_100_102" href="#Footnote_100_102" class="fnanchor">100</a></p>

<p>The question may be raised, why the first solvents mentioned
should have the power to cause ionization, while the second series
of solvents named do not have this power, or have it only to a
very slight extent. Without attempting to enter into an elaborate
discussion of this important question, it may be said that J. J.
Thomson<a id="FNanchor_101_103" href="#Footnote_101_103" class="fnanchor">101</a> and Nernst<a id="FNanchor_102_104" href="#Footnote_102_104" class="fnanchor">102</a> suggested that the ionizing powers of solvents
must be intimately connected with their <em class="italic">dielectric behavior</em>,
and this view has now been well established. It may be said,
in simple terms, that the so-called dielectric constant of a solvent
determines the force with which electrical charges will attract and
repel each other; the higher the dielectric coefficient of a medium,
the <em class="italic">smaller will be the attraction between opposite electrical charges</em>,
other conditions being the same. In solvents, then, of high
dielectric powers, the coëxistence of oppositely charged particles
must be more favored than in solvents of low dielectric powers.
The dielectric constants of a number of solvents are given in the
following table: <a id="p063" class="xxpn">[p063]</a></p>

<table summary="dielectric constants of solvents">

<p>It is quite apparent that the good ionizing media have, as a
matter of fact, the highest constants; those which cause ionization,
at most minimally (<em class="italic">e.g.</em> benzene), the lowest.</p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p>Recent extended and exact investigations by Walden<a id="FNanchor_103_105" href="#Footnote_103_105" class="fnanchor">103</a> have succeeded in
bringing the ionizing power of solvents into definite quantitative relations to
their dielectric constants, with the result that order has been brought out
of a condition of chaos that, for a number of years, existed in this field, as
the result of conclusions based on incomplete data. Conductivity being a
function both of the proportion of dissociated electrolyte and of the mobility
of the ions in a given solution, Walden determined, for a certain salt (an organic
derivative of ammonium iodide, namely, tetraethyl ammonium iodide
<span class="ibnowrap">N(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>I),</span> for all solvents used, not only the conductivities for finite dilutions
but also, by extrapolation, the limiting values for infinite dilution. He
was thus able to determine the degree of ionization of the salt. Some of his
results are particularly interesting; for instance, a <em class="italic">poorly conducting</em> solution,
such as that of the salt in glycol, a solvent resembling glycerine in general
character, may contain the dissolved electrolyte in a <em class="italic">highly ionized</em> state, while
in a much better conducting solution the degree of ionization may be much
smaller—the low conductivity of the first solution being the result of a very
high friction and of the slow motion of the ions, while the well-conducting
solution might show a very high degree of mobility of the ions. The mobility
changes with the nature of the solvent, and the limit, Λ<sub>∞</sub>, of the equivalent
conductivity of the salt, as found by Walden, ranges from 8 in glycol, which is
a thick, viscous oil like glycerine, to 200 in acetonitrile, a thin mobile solvent.
In the one solution, an observed conductivity of 4 represents 50% ionization
of the salt, in the other only 2%.</p>

<p>Now, for solutions of a given electrolyte—tetraethyl ammonium iodide
was used—Walden<a id="FNanchor_104_106" href="#Footnote_104_106" class="fnanchor">104</a> found the following exceedingly interesting relation
between the ionizations in, and the dielectric constants of, various solvents:</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
<em class="italic">e</em><sub>1</sub> : ∛<em class="italic">c</em><sub>1</sub> = <em class="italic">e</em><sub>2</sub> : ∛<em class="italic">c</em><sub>2</sub> = a constant,

<p class="continue">where <em class="italic">e</em><sub>1</sub> and <em class="italic">e</em><sub>2</sub> represent the dielectric constants of different solvents, and <em class="italic">c</em><sub>1</sub>
and <em class="italic">c</em><sub>2</sub> represent the concentrations of the salt in the solvents when the salt is
<em class="italic">ionized to the same degree<a id="FNanchor_105_107" href="#Footnote_105_107" class="fnanchor">105</a> in the two solutions</em>.</p>

<p>The bearing of the relation is apparent from the data
in the following <a id="p064" class="xxpn">[p064]</a>
table.<a id="FNanchor_106_108" href="#Footnote_106_108"
class="fnanchor">106</a> The upper half of the table gives
the dielectric constants (column two) of the solvents named in
column one; the concentrations which show identical degrees of
ionization—47%—are given in the third column, and the last column
gives the value of the relation <em class="italic">e</em> : ∛<em

same kind of data, for the same salt, when its degree of ionization
is 91%, in the different solutions examined. It is clear that the

constants.</p>

<p>All solutions, including aqueous solutions, are thus brought into one general

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Ionizing Power of Solvents Related to the Unsaturated
Condition of their Simple Molecules and to their Power of
Association.</h4>—A careful scrutiny of the group of highly-ionizing
solvents (p. <a href="#p062">62</a>) brings out another interesting relation, to which
attention is called because it is a chemical one, and which should
always be considered in connection with reactions in such solvents.
It is well known that ammonia is an <em class="italic">unsaturated</em> body,
combining readily with all acids, and with many salts, such as
copper sulphate. The fact may be recalled, that this unsaturated
condition is ascribed to the unsaturated nitrogen atom in the
molecule of ammonia, the nitrogen showing a valence of only 3 in
ammonia, whereas in the derivatives it forms when it saturates
itself with the compounds mentioned, <em class="italic">e.g.</em> in H<sub>4</sub>NCl, it has five
saturated valences. Assuming that a valence consists in a unit
charge, positive or negative, on the atom (pp. <a href="#p042">42</a>, <a href="#p059">59</a>), a view which
has almost become a certainty, we should decide that the two free
valences in ammonia must consist of a negative and a positive
charge, as expressed in H<sub>3</sub>N<sup>±</sup>. (We may imagine such a double
<a id="p065" class="xxpn">[p065]</a> charge to be produced by the movement of one electron of
the nitrogen atom to a position in that atom which would make
one point of the atom negative and the other positive.) As a
matter of fact, we find ammonia uniting with hydrogen chloride,
by absorbing a positive and a negative fragment of it—producing
H<sub>4</sub>NCl from H<sub>3</sub>N<sup>±</sup> + H<sup>+</sup> + Cl<sup>−</sup>. It is also evident that, through
these charges, ammonia could combine with itself to form larger
complexes, <sup>+</sup>NH<sub>3</sub>-NH<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, in which we would still have two opposite
charges, presumably removed further from each other than in the
simple molecule. The new molecule could, in turn, by virtue of
its charges, combine with a further molecule to form a still
larger or more <em class="italic">associated</em> molecule, <sup>+</sup>NH<sub>3</sub>-NH<sub>3</sub>-NH<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, and such
<em class="italic">association</em> could evidently go still further. One can readily see
that such molecules would be <em class="italic">electrically polarized</em>, and their charges
might easily have the <em class="italic">power to cause<a id="FNanchor_107_109" href="#Footnote_107_109" class="fnanchor">107</a> electrolytic dissociation or
ionization</em>. The larger the associated molecule, the further apart
might be the positive and negative charges upon it: the further
apart the charges, the smaller would be their mutual attraction:
and the smaller the mutual attraction, the stronger, presumably,
would the dissociating power of such a molecule be. The dissociation
may be effected, possibly, by the <em class="italic">action of these intensified
charges</em> upon <em class="italic">charges already existing</em><a id="FNanchor_108_110" href="#Footnote_108_110" class="fnanchor">108</a> within the molecule of the

have the functions of the aqueous acids<a id="FNanchor_109_111"
href="#Footnote_109_111" class="fnanchor">109</a>; that is, the
<em class="italic">hydrogen-ion</em> of the acids is found <em

class="ibnowrap"><sup>+</sup>(NH<sub>3</sub>-NH<sub>3</sub>)H,</span>

class="ibnowrap"><sup>+</sup>NH<sub>3</sub>-NH<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup></span>
appear thus as <em class="italic">possible active agents</em> in
this dissociation of the hydrogen chloride molecules. <a id="p066"

<p>Now, it is a significant fact that all the best ionizing
solvents are compounds whose simple <em class="italic">molecules
are unsaturated</em> exactly like those of ammonia; this is
true for water H<sub>2</sub>O, the unsaturated character of
whose oxygen atom is now universally recognized. It is now
a familiar fact that liquid water is not represented by the
formula H<sub>2</sub>O but consists of more complex molecules
(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>n</sub>. According to the most recent
investigations,<a id="FNanchor_111_113" href="#Footnote_111_113"
class="fnanchor">111</a> while steam is H<sub>2</sub>O, or
monohydrol, ice is trihydrol (H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>, and
liquid water, at ordinary temperatures, a mixture consisting chiefly
of dihydrol (H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>, some trihydrol, and very
little monohydrol. The proportion of the last appears to increase
with a rise of temperature; the proportion of trihydrol seems to
increase with a fall in temperature. One can easily see how such
aggregates would result from the saturation of the free charges
on oxygen, by further molecules of water. One can also see that
such an association of water molecules could leave a positive and
a negative charge on the associated molecules, which would be <em
class="italic">polarized</em> and more effective than the simple
molecule would be.</p>

<p>That the molecule of hydrogen cyanide contains a similarly
unsaturated atom was demonstrated by Nef.<a id="FNanchor_112_114" href="#Footnote_112_114" class="fnanchor">112</a> He proved that the
behavior of hydrocyanic acid agrees with the structure expressed
by the formula HN═C═, which we may well write HN═C<sup>±</sup>.
In sulphur dioxide, another good ionizing solvent, we have, similarly,
unsaturated sulphur, the sulphur atom being here quadrivalent,
whereas its maximum valence is six.</p>

<p>Now, the ionizing power of solvents like water, ammonia, etc.,
has been ascribed, by various chemists, not only to their dielectric
properties, but also to the <em class="italic">unsaturated condition of their molecules,
and particularly to their powers of association into large molecules</em>.
The relations developed suggest that <em class="italic">all three properties are most
intimately related</em>, the dielectric properties and the powers of association
being consequences, possibly, of the fundamental condition
of unsaturation, and of the great tendency toward self-saturation,<a id="FNanchor_113_115" href="#Footnote_113_115" class="fnanchor">113</a>
of the simple molecules of the best ionizing solvents. From
Walden's work it appears that the dielectric constant finally
determines the quantitative ionizing effect of a solvent.</p>

By applying the corrections demanded by the kinetic theory (van der

The usual experimental methods consist in determining the elevation of
the boiling-point, or the lowering of the freezing-point, or the lowering of the
vapor tension of a solvent by a solute, methods which were discovered by
Raoult and used empirically until van&#160;'t Hoff developed their relations to
the Avogadro principle. The calculation of a molecular weight is much
simplified by the use of the different specific constants expressing the lowering
or elevation produced by one gram-molecule or mole, dissolved either in
one liter or in 100 grams of each specific solvent.</p></div>

Or, on the basis of the accepted molecular weights, abnormally high
osmotic pressures, abnormally great lowerings of the freezing-point, raisings
of the boiling-point, etc., were obtained. Van&#160;'t Hoff, originally, on account
of these discrepancies, considered this extension of the Avogadro Hypothesis
to hold only for the "majority" of substances in solution, not for all (Arrhenius,
<em class="italic">loc. cit.</em>). It was considered to have <em class="italic">universal</em> application (for dilute

That is, hydrogen chloride, in aqueous solution, depresses the vapor

more than an <em class="italic">equimolecular</em> quantity, for instance, of glucose does, and gives

A fourth interpretation advanced at one time in opposition to the
theory of ionization is that salts like sodium chloride and zinc chloride are
<em class="italic">hydrolyzed</em> and thereby produce more solute molecules, <em class="italic">e.g.</em> NaCl + H<sub>2</sub>O → NaOH + HCl. Aside from the fact that such hydrolysis of salts, when it
does occur (Chapter X.), is easily detected, and that it can be proved not to
occur appreciably in the case of sodium chloride (<em class="italic">loc. cit.</em>), this interpretation
fails utterly to account for the results obtained with <em class="italic">acids, e.g.</em> HCl, HNO<sub>3</sub>,
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and with <em class="italic">bases</em>, <em class="italic">e.g.</em> NaOH, Ba(OH)<sub>2</sub>, which in aqueous solutions show
an increase in the number of molecules as great as shown by salts. This
explanation is therefore untenable.</p></div>

In the case of double salts, such as sodium-ammonium phosphate,
and similar compounds, the dissociation leads to the formation of more than
two products. The molecules of two or more different products may then
be charged positively and, conversely, there may be two or more different
products of dissociation carrying negative charges. We have, for instance,
Na(NH<sub>4</sub>)HPO<sub>4</sub> ⇄ Na<sup>+</sup> + NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> + H<sup>+</sup> + PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup> and Na(NH<sub>4</sub>)HPO<sub>4</sub> ⇄ Na<sup>+</sup> +
NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> + HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>. In all cases the rule concerning the sum of all the
charges, as expressed in (2), must be fulfilled, the charge on the phosphate
ion, PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup>, being three times as great as that on a sodium, ammonium, or
hydrogen ion; that on the acid phosphate ion, HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>, being twice as great.</p></div>

The copper electrodes are polarized by the formation of hydrogen on
the cathode, but, in the course of a few seconds, the current becomes rather
constant and is then read. The polarization may be considered as simply
reducing the potential of the cell, and since, within the range of concentrations
of acid used,—4-molar to 1/8-molar—the polarization current does not vary
markedly, as compared with the potential of the storage cell, the total potential
used through the series of dilutions may be considered sufficiently constant
for the purposes of the experiment. Readings are made three or four
seconds after each dilution, when the polarization has been fully established.
Polarization may be entirely avoided by the use of a silver nitrate solution
and silver electrodes or of a cupric salt solution and copper electrodes (Noyes
and Blanchard). Hydrochloric acid is used here in order to carry the discussion
in the text as far as possible with this typical ionogen. If one takes care
to make readings as described, the result is quite satisfactory, as is shown by
the comparison of the ratios of the readings with the ratios calculated from the
known conductivities of the various dilutions (see table below).</p></div>

<a href="#Contents">TOC</a></div>

<p>We will turn now to the consideration of evidence bearing on
the theory of ionization, found in the data on osmotic pressure.
The apparent molecular weight of hydrogen chloride is found to be
smaller than 36.5, when determined in aqueous solution (p. <a href="#p037">37</a>), and
it is found to approach the limit 18.25 as a more and more dilute
acid is used.<a id="FNanchor_114_118" href="#Footnote_114_118"
class="fnanchor">114</a> The value found represents the average
molecular weight of all the molecules in any solution, the osmotic
pressure, freezing-point or boiling-point of which has been taken.
It is evident that, if there is dissociation of hydrogen chloride
into hydrogen and chloride ions, the average values found for the
molecular weight must be lower than 36.5, <em class="italic">must
be variable</em>, and must <em class="italic">approach</em> the
<em class="italic">limit</em> 18.25, as the dissociation into
the smaller molecules becomes more and more complete. Such a
result is, therefore, what we would anticipate on the basis of
the theory of ionization. For a salt like potassium chloride KCl,
a similar tendency toward a minimum, average molecular weight of
<span class="ibnowrap">(K<sup>+</sup> + Cl<sup>−</sup>) / 2</span>
or <span class="ibnowrap">(39.1 + 35.5) / 2 = 37.3</span>
would be anticipated, and, as a matter of fact,
molecular weight determinations with potassium chloride
in aqueous solution give results agreeing with such a
tendency.<a id="FNanchor_115_119" href="#Footnote_115_119"
class="fnanchor">115</a> For a salt like calcium chloride, on
the other hand, we would expect that its ionization into <em
class="italic">three</em> ions, according to the equation <span
class="ibnowrap">CaCl<sub>2</sub> ⇄ Ca<sup>2+</sup> + 2 Cl<sup>−</sup>,</span>
would give a minimum, not of one-half the
formula weight, but of one-third, viz., <span
class="ibnowrap">(Ca<sup>2+</sup> + 2 Cl<sup>−</sup>) / 3</span>
or <span class="ibnowrap">(40 + 71) / 3 = 37,</span> when
the molecular weight determination is carried out in aqueous
solution. As a matter of fact, with salts of this type,
the determinations, by osmotic pressure methods, indicate
a dissociation into <em class="italic">three</em> smaller
components, as required by the theory. It may be added that,
for <a id="p068" class="xxpn">[p068]</a> a salt, sodium
mellitate, Na<sub>6</sub>(C<sub>12</sub>O<sub>12</sub>), the
salt of a hexabasic acid, Taylor found average molecular weights
tending to a minimum of <em class="italic">one-seventh</em>
of the formula weight, as we should expect from the
ionization of the salt into seven smaller molecules, <span
class="ibnowrap">(C<sub>12</sub>O<sub>12</sub>)Na<sub>6</sub> ⇄</span> <span
class="ibnowrap">6 Na<sup>+</sup> + (C<sub>12</sub>O<sub>12</sub>)<sup>6−</sup>.</span></p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Quantitative Evidence.</h4>—Some of the most exact quantitative
evidence bearing on these relations, such as the results of investigations,
by Griffith and by Taylor, on the freezing-point depressions
of solutions of electrolytes, may be briefly considered.
The depression of the freezing-point of a given solvent by a solute
is proportional to the concentration of the solute or proportional
to its osmotic pressure. Further, according to the Van&#160;'t Hoff
Hypothesis (p. <a href="#p015">15</a>), the osmotic pressure at a constant temperature
is dependent only on the number of molecules present in unit
volume, and not on the nature or composition of the molecules:
the freezing-point of the solvent is depressed, likewise, proportionally
to the total concentration of the solute, irrespective of the
fact whether the solution contains only one, or more than one
molecular species. <em class="italic">The ratio, observed depression / concentration</em>,<a id="FNanchor_116_120" href="#Footnote_116_120" class="fnanchor">116</a>
or <em class="italic">Δ</em> / <em class="italic">C</em>, <em class="italic">should be constant</em>,<a id="FNanchor_117_121" href="#Footnote_117_121" class="fnanchor">117</a> therefore, in a given solvent, for dilute
solutions of all kinds of solutes, simple or mixed. Griffith<a id="FNanchor_118_122" href="#Footnote_118_122" class="fnanchor">118</a> found,
for a solution of cane sugar, a non-electrolyte, in water, the
ratio of the freezing-point depression to the concentration to be
1.858°. For instance, the freezing-point of a 0.01 molar solution
of cane sugar (3.42 grams of cane sugar per liter;
C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub> = 342) is found to be −0.01858°,
and 0.01858 / 0.01 = 1.858. This
ratio should be the same, as stated above, according to van&#160;'t
Hoff's theory of solutions, for dilute aqueous solutions of all solutes.
But the ratio <em class="italic">Δ</em> / <em class="italic">C</em> for an aqueous solution of potassium chloride,
an electrolyte, <em class="italic">was found to increase slowly</em> and <em class="italic">continuously</em> until
in 0.0003 molar solution the ratio 3.72 was found, which is exactly
twice the value obtained with cane sugar. The result indicates,
therefore, a <em class="italic">gradual dissociation</em> of the potassium chloride with
<em class="italic">increasing</em> dilution, and a <em class="italic">dissociation, ultimately, of each molecule</em>
of the salt into <em class="italic">two</em> new molecules, in all respects exactly as demanded
by the theory of Arrhenius.</div>

<p>Loomis<a id="FNanchor_119_123" href="#Footnote_119_123" class="fnanchor">119</a> found in a similar way a ratio of 3.61 for HCl, 3.71
<a id="p069" class="xxpn">[p069]</a> for KOH, 3.60 for KCl, 3.67 for NaCl, 3.73 for HNO<sub>3</sub>, etc.,
when 0.01 molar aqueous solutions were used. For similar
solutions of calcium chloride CaCl<sub>2</sub>, magnesium chloride MgCl<sub>2</sub>,
and sodium sulphate Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, the value 5.07 was found as the
ratio between the depressions of the freezing-point and the concentration
of the salts in extremely dilute solutions—a result
showing, plainly, a dissociation of each salt into <em class="italic">three smaller molecules</em>.
The limit 5.67 for such a dissociation is not quite reached
in these cases, because salts of the types Me″X<sub>2</sub> and Me<sub>2</sub>′Y″ ionize
less readily than do the electrolytes Me′X′, a fact also shown by
their conductivities.</p>

<p>We thus find that the most exact work on molecular weight
determinations in <em class="italic">dilute</em> aqueous solutions agrees excellently, as
does the conductivity of such solutions, with the demands of the
theory of ionization, a fact which is particularly impressive because
osmotic pressure and electrical conductivity are in no wise fundamentally
related phenomena, and yet each, as a measure of
ionization or electrolytic dissociation, leads independently to the
same conclusion.<a id="FNanchor_120_124" href="#Footnote_120_124" class="fnanchor">120</a></p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Chemical Composition of the Ions of Electrolytes.</h4>—Accepting
the theory of Arrhenius, we may now inquire more
closely than heretofore, first, what compounds are subject to
electrolytic dissociation, and then, what the chemical composition
of their ions is and how it is determined.</div>

<p>The compounds which are dissociated into ions, by solvents
which cause ionization (p. <a href="#p062">62</a>), comprise the <em class="italic">salts</em>, the <em class="italic">acids</em> and
the <em class="italic">bases</em>; chemists are, in fact, more inclined now to invert the
statement and say that those substances which have long been
known as salts, acids and bases, owe the essential characteristics,
which led to their classification, to the fact that they are ionizable
(see pp. <a href="#p072">72</a>–<a href="#p082">82</a>). The composition of the ions, formed from the
simpler of these compounds,<a id="FNanchor_121_125" href="#Footnote_121_125" class="fnanchor">121</a> may be expressed by saying that the
metal component or metal-like component (hydrogen, ammonium)
forms the positive ion (cation, metal ion) and all the rest of the
<a id="p070" class="xxpn">[p070]</a> molecule forms the negative ion (anion, acid ion<a id="FNanchor_122_126" href="#Footnote_122_126" class="fnanchor">122</a>). Thus, sodium
chloride, nitrate, sulphate, phosphate yield the sodium-ion, Na<sup>+</sup>, and
the chloride (Cl<sup>−</sup>), nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>), sulphate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>), or phosphate
(PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup>) ions; cupric nitrate Cu(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> dissociates into the cupric
ion (Cu<sup>2+</sup>) and the nitrate ion, calcium sulphate CaSO<sub>4</sub> into the
calcium-ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and the sulphate-ion, aluminium sulphate
Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> into the aluminium-ion (Al<sup>3+</sup>) and the sulphate-ion.</p>

<p>But the question arises, as to how we know that the salts mentioned
produce ions of the given composition; why, for instance,
should sodium nitrate be considered to dissociate into sodium, Na<sup>+</sup>,
and nitrate ions, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, the nitrogen atom carrying all of the
oxygen atoms with it in the negative ion?</p>

<div id="i082" class="figleft">
<img src="images/i082.jpg" width="200" height="375" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><em class="smcap">Fig. 13.</em></div>
</div>

<p>The composition of the ions of a salt can be determined experimentally<a id="FNanchor_123_127" href="#Footnote_123_127" class="fnanchor">123</a>
by devices of which the U-tube experiment (p. <a href="#p045">45</a>) may
be considered to be a simple type. For instance,
if we wish to determine the composition
of the ions of sodium nitrate, we could
cover a solution of sodium nitrate with a
solution, say, of hydrochloric acid, pass a
current through the liquids, and determine
the composition of the components that have
moved to the negative and positive poles,
respectively. In practice, the device could
be elaborated for the sake of convenience.
Stopcocks, for instance, might be placed in
the U-tube, at the points of separation of the
nitrate solution and the hydrochloric acid
(see Fig. 13), the stopcocks being opened
only during the passage of the current. Or
porous plates or cells might be used, in place of stopcocks, at these
<a id="p071" class="xxpn">[p071]</a> points. Now, if we assume sodium nitrate to be dissociated,
not into Na<sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, but let us say into positive ions NaO<sup>+</sup> and
negative ions NO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>, the changes which would result from the passage
of a current would be as follows: starting with the action at the
positive pole, we should find chloride ions discharged and chlorine
evolved at the pole (the evolution of chlorine could be avoided, if
considered desirable, by the use of a silver anode, which would absorb
the liberated chloride-ion to form insoluble silver chloride on
the electrode). At the same time, hydrogen ions would move out
of the space <em class="italic">P</em>, being repelled by the positive pole, and attracted by
the negative. At the boundary between the sodium nitrate solution
and the hydrochloric acid, the negative ions of sodium nitrate,
which we are supposing to have the composition NO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>, would
move up from <em class="italic">B</em> toward the positive pole (<em class="italic">cf.</em> exp., p. <a href="#p045">45</a>),
being attracted by its charge; at any moment we should have
in any part of <em class="italic">P</em> as many negative ions (Cl<sup>−</sup> and NO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>), as
there are hydrogen ions, the solution showing no excess of free
electricity at any point. Now, if NO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> were the ion that moved
up into the space <em class="italic">P</em>, then we should presently find <em class="italic">nitrous</em> acid
<em class="italic">around</em> the <em class="italic">positive pole</em> in space <em class="italic">P</em>, H<sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> combining to
form nitrous acid, HNO<sub>2</sub>. But, as a matter of experiment, although
the tests for nitrous acid belong to the most sensitive ones
in chemistry, no trace of this acid is found there; what we do find
is <em class="italic">nitric acid</em>, HNO<sub>3</sub>, resulting obviously from the presence in space
<em class="italic">P</em> of both hydrogen ions and <em class="italic">nitrate ions</em>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, which have moved
up from space <em class="italic">B</em>. It is clear, that the presence of nitric acid in
the region around the positive pole means that the nitrogen atoms
must have carried with them all three of the oxygen atoms of the
nitrate—in a word, that the composition of the negative ion of
sodium nitrate is NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> and not, say, NO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>. Similarly, considering
what happens in space <em class="italic">N</em>, round the negative pole, we have here an
evolution of hydrogen, a migration of some chloride ions out of <em class="italic">N</em>
into the space <em class="italic">C</em>, and, at the same time, a migration of the positive
ions of space <em class="italic">C</em> into the division <em class="italic">N</em>. On examining the solution
in <em class="italic">N</em>, we now find sodium chloride, with unchanged hydrochloric
acid, exactly what we should expect from the migration of the ion
Na<sup>+</sup> toward the negative electrode.<a id="FNanchor_124_128" href="#Footnote_124_128" class="fnanchor">124</a> If the positive ion were, say,
<a id="p072" class="xxpn">[p072]</a> NaO<sup>+</sup>, we should expect to obtain either some of the hypochlorite
NaOCl (NaO<sup>+</sup> + Cl<sup>−</sup>), or, at least, an evolution of oxygen in this
place, since sodium chloride is formed. As a matter of experiment,
no oxygen is evolved here, and no trace of hypochlorite is found in
<em class="italic">N</em> round the negative pole, although the tests for hypochlorites
are extremely sensitive.</p>

<p>Comparatively simple methods, in principle of the nature outlined,
enable us, then, to <em class="italic">determine experimentally</em> the composition
of the ions into which ionizable compounds, salts, acids and bases,
dissociate. Whenever any doubt may exist about the composition
of the ions of a given electrolyte, this device may be employed to
settle the matter, and there will presently be occasion to employ
the U-tube for such a purpose.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Ionization and Chemical Activity.</h4>—The fact that the theory of
ionization gives us adequate explanations of the conductivity shown
by dissolved electrolytes and of their abnormally high osmotic
pressures, would have been in itself of interest to chemists; but,
if its applications were limited to these phenomena, we should not
be considering it in connection with qualitative chemical analysis,
nor would the theory, presumably, have greatly affected the
development of chemistry, as it has done. It is the fact that
the electrolytic dissociation of an electrolyte into its ions involves
<em class="italic">chemical</em> changes of the most profound nature, and most intimately
affects <em class="italic">chemical</em> reactivity, that has made it play, in the last two
decades, such a leading rôle in the development of chemistry, and
that makes it necessary to include its consequences in the consideration
of analytical problems, if one would understand, as far
as present knowledge permits, the reactions involved in chemical
analysis.</div>

<p>Hydrogen chloride, as a perfectly dry gas, is a non-conductor
of electricity and, at the same time, it is found to be chemically
<em class="italic">inactive</em>—it does not combine, for instance, with dry ammonia<a id="FNanchor_125_129" href="#Footnote_125_129" class="fnanchor">125</a> or
act upon dry calcium carbonate<a id="FNanchor_126_130" href="#Footnote_126_130" class="fnanchor">126</a> or on dry litmus. Hydrogen
chloride, subjected to great pressure at a low temperature, is
liquefied. The liquid is also a very poor conductor of
<a id="p073" class="xxpn">[p073]</a>
electricity<a id="FNanchor_127_131" href="#Footnote_127_131" class="fnanchor">127</a>
and does not show the chemical activity of ordinary,
aqueous hydrochloric acid; it does not combine with calcium
oxide or attack marble, zinc, iron or even magnesium.<a href="#Footnote_127_131" class="fnanchor">127</a></p>

<p>A solution of hydrogen chloride in a poorly ionizing medium,
like benzene or toluene, is an extremely poor conductor. There
is an extremely small conductivity indicating only a trace of
ionization.<a id="FNanchor_128_132" href="#Footnote_128_132" class="fnanchor">128</a></p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p><em class="smcap">Exp.</em> A solution of hydrogen chloride, prepared by passing the dried
gas into benzene or toluene (thiophene-free benzene will not become discolored),
and kept anhydrous by means of fused calcium chloride, is tested
for its conductivity, by dipping into it electrodes connected with a lighting
circuit and a galvanometer.</p></div>

<p>Such a solution behaves chemically, also, quite differently
from the aqueous solutions of hydrogen chloride with which we
are familiar: dry steel
nails,<a id="FNanchor_129_133" href="#Footnote_129_133" class="fnanchor">129</a>
dropped into it, will remain almost
unchanged—there is no marked evolution of hydrogen (<em class="italic">exp.</em>).
Perfectly dried marble, added to it, will not give rise to the evolution
of carbon dioxide<a href="#Footnote_129_133" class="fnanchor">129</a>
(<em class="italic">exp.</em>). We find thus, in all the cases discussed—the
nonconducting dry gas, the anhydrous liquefied hydrogen
chloride and the anhydrous benzene solution—an absence of
ionization,<a id="FNanchor_130_134" href="#Footnote_130_134" class="fnanchor">130</a>
as indicated by the lack of conductivity, and, along with
this, a lack of the familiar action of hydrochloric acid as an acid.
If we dissolve the gas in water, we obtain a well-conducting solution
(<em class="italic">exp.</em>), in which, according to molecular weight determinations, the
<a id="p074" class="xxpn">[p074]</a> hydrogen chloride is more or less largely ionized, and this same
solution has all the well-known chemical properties of hydrochloric
acid—it evolves hydrogen liberally when given an opportunity
to act upon zinc or iron (<em class="italic">exp.</em>), it evolves carbon dioxide
copiously when marble is brought into contact with it (<em class="italic">exp.</em>).
In such an aqueous solution we have both the ions of the acid and
the more or less non-ionized hydrogen chloride, the action (HCl ⇄ H<sup>+</sup> + Cl<sup>−</sup>) being reversible.</p>

<p>Now, since in those cases in which we have admittedly only non-ionized
hydrogen chloride, there is no vigorous chemical action,
we are bound to conclude that, in the aqueous solution where
we have both the non-ionized and the ionized substance, it must be
the new components, the ions of the acid, which give this solution
its new qualities, the well-known properties of a pronounced
acid.<a id="FNanchor_131_135" href="#Footnote_131_135" class="fnanchor">131</a> This conclusion, that the acid properties of hydrogen
chloride in aqueous solution are due to the ionized hydrogen
chloride, rather than to the hydrogen chloride itself, is one of
fundamental importance.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Dry Salts and their Aqueous Solutions.</h4>—If
the study of the relation of ionization to chemical activity be
extended, it is found that a dry salt, such as, for example, silver
nitrate, in crystals or finely pulverized, is not perceptibly
ionized, for it is a non-conductor (<em class="italic">exp.</em>).
The same result is obtained with potassium chromate. If the dry
powders are intimately mixed, there is no chemical action between
them, no perceptible change occurs. The aqueous solutions of the
salts are excellent conductors (<em class="italic">exp.</em>), as
are the aqueous solutions of almost all salts; the dissolved salts
are therefore largely ionized. As soon as the ionizing medium,
water, is added to the dry, yellow mixture of silver nitrate and
potassium chromate, instantly a chemical change results—red silver
chromate, Ag<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub>, is precipitated (<em
class="italic">exp.</em>). Now, in the aqueous solution of these
salts we have both non-ionized molecules and their ions:</div>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
<span class="ibnowrap">AgNO<sub>3</sub> ⇄ Ag<sup>+</sup> + NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>,
<br />
K<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub> ⇄ 2 K<sup>+</sup> + CrO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>.
</span></div></div>

<p>Since there is no interaction when the dry salts, containing only the
non-ionized substances, are mixed, and since there is interaction
<a id="p075" class="xxpn">[p075]</a> when the solutions are mixed, in which both the non-ionized
and the ionized salts are present, one must conclude again that
the formation of silver chromate is the result of the action of the
silver ions on the chromate ions in the solution. In point of fact,
there could hardly fail to be an action, since the positive silver
ions and the negative chromate ions, moving in all directions
through the solution, must collide and be discharged, or combine,
to form molecular silver chromate. This salt happens to be
very difficultly soluble, and to be colored red, as well, so that
silver chromate is precipitated and is immediately recognizable.</p>

<p>The two dry powders in the experiment were allowed to be in
contact for only a few moments. It is important to note, therefore,
that dry sodium acid carbonate and dry potassium acid tartrate
are also nonconductors (<em class="italic">exp.</em>), and that the intimate mixture of
these two powders is kept for years in the well-known form of
baking powders without appreciable decomposition—yet best in
tin vessels, to exclude moisture. The aqueous solutions, however,
are good conductors (<em class="italic">exp.</em>), and, when dissolved, these salts are
more or less ionized. The addition of water to the mixed salts
(<em class="italic">exp.</em>) leads at once to the well-known action, carbon dioxide
being liberated and sodium-potassium tartrate or Rochelle salt
being formed.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Behavior of Fused Salts.</h4>—It may be objected that there are
common cases, where dry salts are known to act upon each other;
barium sulphate is fused with sodium carbonate to convert the
former into the carbonate, BaSO<sub>4</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> ⇄ Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + BaCO<sub>3</sub>.
Before one decides that this must be an instance of the action of
non-ionized salts on each other, the conductivity of dry salts
under the conditions of the experiment, namely at an elevated
temperature, must be examined. There is no difficulty in recognizing
that while dry sodium carbonate or potassium nitrate at
ordinary temperatures does not conduct a current, and is not
perceptibly ionized, each salt, when fused, becomes an excellent
conductor (<em class="italic">exp.</em>,<a id="FNanchor_132_136" href="#Footnote_132_136" class="fnanchor">132</a> with potassium nitrate). It is, in fact, well known
that, in many electrolytic operations, fused salts<a id="FNanchor_133_137" href="#Footnote_133_137" class="fnanchor">133</a> are used in place
<a id="p076" class="xxpn">[p076]</a> of solutions. It must be added that the heat, not the change of
state, causes the ionization, careful work having shown that conductivity
begins to be appreciable below the point of fusion.</div>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p><em class="smcap">Exp.</em> Two platinum wires, fused, one inch apart, into a glass rod, are
connected with a sensitive galvanometer and the lighting circuit. When
the glass is warmed, a current is found to pass.</p></div>

<p>The action between barium sulphate and sodium carbonate at
a high temperature does not mean, then, that the non-ionized salts
interact; on the contrary, we find that, under such conditions,
coincident with the evidence of reactivity, we have also decided
conductivity—again indicating decided ionization.</p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<div class="h4p"><h4>Dry Salts at Ordinary Temperatures.</h4>—Inasmuch as ordinary temperatures
are still far removed from the absolute zero, one must suppose that dry
salts must be ionized, minimally at least, even at room temperature, and should
therefore react with each other. Presumably they do, only so slowly, as a
result of the minimal degrees of ionization, and of the few chances of collision
between ions of opposite charges, owing to the restricted range of the molecular
motions, that the total change is imperceptible. Critical work on the
question is most desirable. In this connection it maybe said that Spring<a id="FNanchor_134_138" href="#Footnote_134_138" class="fnanchor">134</a>
found that dry salts do interact at ordinary temperature, when <em class="italic">subjected to
great pressures</em>, provided the volume of the products is smaller than the volume
of the initial substances. Whether this action is due to the ionization of the
salts, minimal as it is, or whether we have here a case of interaction of non-ionized
molecules, has not, it seems, been determined; it would require difficult
quantitative work to settle the question.</div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Influence of Light and Heat.</h4>—It is apparent that heat, a form of energy,
contributes to the dissociation of ionogens, and it is natural that we should
consider other forms of energy, <em class="italic">e.g.</em> light, to have the same power. One
may speculate about the possibility of light inducing chemical action (<em class="italic">e.g.</em>
in starting the combination of hydrogen and chlorine, or in photography)
by its ionizing power, and about the possibility that rapid combination of
oxygen and hydrogen follows the application of a flame to the mixture, as
the result of increased ionization of the components at the elevated temperature
of the flame and of the burning gases. The experimental evidence shows
that, in some actions of this nature, ionization is an important factor, while
in other instances it appears to be negligible.<a id="FNanchor_135_139" href="#Footnote_135_139" class="fnanchor">135</a> <a id="p077" class="xxpn">[p077]</a></div></div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Conclusions.</h4>—It appears that we must accept the conclusion,
that the <em class="italic">reactions of salts</em>, <em class="italic">acids</em> and <em class="italic">bases</em> (ionogens) <em class="italic">in aqueous
solution</em> (the so-called "salt reactions") <em class="italic">are the reactions of the ions
and not of the non-ionized molecules.</em> This conclusion is of the
greatest and most practical importance in our science. It is the
natural inference from the results of the qualitative experiments
described in the three preceding sections. Its final adoption,
however, is based on the existence of a great mass of <em class="italic">quantitative
evidence</em>, and to the consideration of some of this we now turn.</div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Quantitative Relations.</h4>—If the active components in aqueous
solutions of acids, bases and salts are the ions, rather than the
undissociated compounds, then quantitative data supporting such
a conclusion should be found. Such quantitative confirmation,
from the point of view of chemical activity, is not lacking.
Only a small part of the data can be considered here.</div>

<p>Conductivity measurements, and the lowering of freezing-points
and the elevation of boiling-points, show that there are very decided
differences <em class="italic">in the degrees of ionization of different acids and bases</em> in
solutions of equivalent concentration. For instance, potassium
hydroxide is somewhat more ionized than is barium hydroxide, and
decidedly more so than ammonium hydroxide, a fact that can
readily be demonstrated by the conductivities of the solutions<a id="FNanchor_136_140" href="#Footnote_136_140" class="fnanchor">136</a>:</p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p><em class="smcap">Exp.</em> Equivalent solutions (1 / 10 normal) of the three bases are introduced
into three vertical tubes, containing electrodes connected, in parallel, with a
lighting circuit and with small electric lamps. When the two electrodes in
each of the three tubes are at equal distances from each other, the lamp
connected with the potassium hydroxide solution glows most brightly, that
connected with the barium hydroxide solution a little less brightly, and the
lamp connected with the ammonium hydroxide solution does not glow at all—not
enough current is carried through the ammonium hydroxide solution
to heat the filament in the corresponding lamp sufficiently to make it red.
Now, the current, for a given fall of potential, is proportional to the conductivity
of a solution (p. <a href="#p048">48</a>) and, in the equivalent solutions<a id="FNanchor_137_141" href="#Footnote_137_141" class="fnanchor">137</a> the conductivity
depends on the proportion of charged particles (the degree of ionization)
of the base. It is clear then, that ammonium hydroxide is very much less
ionized than are the two other bases. <a id="p078" class="xxpn">[p078]</a></p>

<p>The resistance in a tube may be reduced, and the conductivity increased,
by reducing the distance through which the current must be carried, <em class="italic">i.e.</em>
by bringing the electrodes closer together. In the solution of barium hydroxide,
we find that we must reduce the distance between the electrodes to about
five-sixths the corresponding distance in the potassium hydroxide solution
before we obtain, approximately, as bright a lamp from the current passing
through it, and in the case of ammonium hydroxide, we must bring the electrodes
so close together that they almost touch, the distance being only one
or two hundredths of the distance between the electrodes in the potassium
hydroxide solution.</p>

<p>For the degrees of ionization of the three
bases we have, approximately, the relation
α<sub>K</sub> : α<sub>Ba</sub> : α<sub>NH<sub>4</sub></sub> :: <em
class="italic">d</em><sub>K</sub> : <em
class="italic">d</em><sub>Ba</sub> : <em
class="italic">d</em><sub>NH<sub>4</sub></sub>, if we
indicate by <em class="italic">d</em><sub>K</sub>,
<em class="italic">d</em><sub>Ba</sub>, <em
class="italic">d</em><sub>NH<sub>4</sub></sub> the distances between
the electrodes in the three solutions when the lamps are of uniform
brightness, <em class="italic">i.e.</em> when the same quantity
of current passes through each solution. In this deduction, the
conductivities of the bases at infinite dilution (Λ<sub>∞</sub>) are
taken to be the same, which is roughly true.</p></div>

<p>The experiment gives us a rough measure of the relative conductivities
and the relative degrees of ionization of the three bases.
It shows that potassium hydroxide is somewhat more ionized than
is barium hydroxide, in equivalent solution, and decidedly more
than is ammonium hydroxide.</p>

<p>Limiting the further discussion, at this moment, to potassium
hydroxide and ammonium hydroxide, we should find that, since
in equimolar solutions, a larger portion of the former is ionized
than of the latter, <em class="italic">the potassium hydroxide solution must contain
the larger proportion or concentration of hydroxide-ion, HO<sup>−</sup>, which
is the characteristic ion of bases</em>. It should, therefore, show the
<em class="italic">chemical</em> characteristics of a base much more decidedly than the
ammonium hydroxide solution. That such is the case can be very
simply shown by adding equal quantities (0.1 c.c.) of the 0.1
molar solutions to equal volumes (50 c.c.) of water<a id="FNanchor_138_142" href="#Footnote_138_142" class="fnanchor">138</a> containing
some phenolphthaleïn. This is an indicator for bases and acids, like
litmus, but it is less sensitive to hydroxide-ion than is litmus.
We find that the potassium hydroxide causes a very decided
change, producing a deep red color with the phenolphthaleïn,
whereas the ammonium hydroxide only produces a pink hue.<a id="FNanchor_139_143" href="#Footnote_139_143" class="fnanchor">139</a>
<a id="p079" class="xxpn">[p079]</a></p>

<p>In all the chemical changes produced by these alkalies, the
same difference in intensity of action is shown, that is here exhibited
towards indicators. If, for example, we measure the
rate of change in an action, which is slow enough to be measured
<a id="p080" class="xxpn">[p080]</a>
and which proceeds quantitatively in proportion to the concentration
of hydroxide-ion, we find that the measured rates of change
indicate the same ratio in the concentrations of hydroxide-ion
in potassium and ammonium hydroxide solutions, as is indicated
by quantitative conductivity measurements. An action suitable
for the purpose is the saponification of an ester, such as ethyl
acetate. Under the influence of an alkali, like potassium hydroxide,
ethyl acetate is decomposed, more or less rapidly, into an
acetate and alcohol: we have, for instance,</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub> + KOH → CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>K + C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH.
</div></div>

<p class="continue">The rate of saponification is found to be proportional to the <em class="italic">concentration
of hydroxide-ion</em>, and not to the total concentration of
the base, and the action may be formulated more accurately as
follows:</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
<span class="ibnowrap">CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub> + K<sup>+</sup> + HO<sup>−</sup> → CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> + K<sup>+</sup> + C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH
<br />
or CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub> + HO<sup>−</sup> → CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> + C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH.
</span></div></div>

<p class="continue">For ammonium hydroxide we have similarly,</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub> + NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> + HO<sup>−</sup> → CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> + NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> + C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH.
</div></div>

<p class="continue">Now, Arrhenius<a id="FNanchor_140_145" href="#Footnote_140_145" class="fnanchor">140</a> proved that the rate of saponification of ethyl
acetate by ammonium hydroxide, which is <em class="italic">very much slower</em> than
the rate of saponification by potassium hydroxide of equivalent
concentration, <em class="italic">does agree quantitatively, indeed, with the rate demanded
by the theory of ionization</em>, when the hydroxide-ion is
considered the active component of the bases, to which the saponification
is due.</p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p><em class="smcap">Exp.</em> A rough idea of the difference in the chemical actions of the two
bases may be obtained by observing their effects on the ester, methyl acetate,
which is decomposed into an acetate and methyl alcohol rather rapidly.
To 50 c.c. of (CO<sub>2</sub> free) water containing some phenolphthaleïn, 10 c.c. of
0.1 molar potassium hydroxide is added; a similar mixture with 10 c.c. of
0.1 molar ammonium hydroxide solution is prepared. To each of the solutions,
2 c.c. (an excess) of methyl acetate is added (to the ammonium hydroxide
solution first), and the mixtures are shaken for a moment. At room
temperature, the mixture containing potassium hydroxide will become
pale pink in a few minutes, and colorless soon thereafter, while the mixture
<a id="p081" class="xxpn">[p081]</a> containing ammonium hydroxide will still be deep red at the end of 45
minutes.<a id="FNanchor_141_146" href="#Footnote_141_146" class="fnanchor">141</a></p>

<p>In the following tables are summarized some of the results which
have been obtained in comparing the <em class="italic">activity of
bases</em>, in saponifying methyl acetate, and <em class="italic">the
concentrations of the hydroxide-ion</em>, in the solutions of the
bases, as determined by conductivity measurements. The comparisons
are made by representing the activity of the hydroxide-ion in a
solution of lithium hydroxide by 100 and by expressing the ratio of
the activity of a given base to that of the lithium hydroxide in
percentages of the activity of the latter. All the bases were used in
0.025 molar concentration, and their degrees of ionization are given
in the last column of the table.</p>

<p>An ester is decomposed also <em class="italic">under the influence of acids</em>, in aqueous solution,

Now, in 0.1 molar solution, acetic acid is very little ionized (1.3%), as compared
with hydrochloric acid (91%), the degrees of ionization being determined
by conductivity measurements (p. <a href="#p050">50</a>); the relation may easily be demonstrated
with the aid of the conductivity apparatus used to show the difference
in ionization between potassium hydroxide and ammonium hydroxide.
In the presence of 0.1 molar hydrochloric acid, the decomposition of cane sugar
actually proceeds at 79 times the rate that it does in the presence of 0.1 molar
acetic acid. The ratio of the concentrations of the hydrogen-ion in the two
<a id="p082" class="xxpn">[p082]</a> solutions is, in fact, 70 : 1. There is, therefore, close agreement<a id="FNanchor_142_147" href="#Footnote_142_147" class="fnanchor">142</a> between the
<em class="italic">relative chemical activity</em> of the two acids and the relation demanded, if we

<p>In the following table, the relative activities of acids, in accelerating the

more, faster than the anions and carries therefore the greater part of the current,
that the conductivities of acids, in equivalent concentrations, may be considered
an approximate measure of their relative degrees of ionization and

<p>In the following chapters and, indeed, throughout our further
work, we shall continually meet additional instances of the quantitative
relation between chemical activity and ionization. In fact,
the results obtained in the field of quantitative measurement of
chemical action, of which the above are single instances, have
demonstrated, more than anything else, the value of the theory of
ionization to chemistry and the necessity of taking it into account
in expressing the results of chemical action in mathematical
terms. <a id="p083" class="xxpn">[p083]</a></p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Summary.</h4>—Measurements made, then, in three great and
independent fields of investigation, <em class="italic">electrical conductivity</em>, <em class="italic">osmotic
pressure</em> and the allied relations, and <em class="italic">chemical activity</em>, bring
independent testimony to the correctness of the fundamental
assumptions of Arrhenius's theory of ionization. In the quantitative
study of solutions of electrolytes, wherever secondary disturbing
influences are eliminated or are taken into account as far
as possible, the three lines of investigation give results which
agree satisfactorily<a id="FNanchor_143_148" href="#Footnote_143_148" class="fnanchor">143</a> as to the degree of ionization of the electrolytes
under examination. With the aid of this theory, <em class="italic">predictions</em> of the
course of chemical action may now be made more definitely and with
more assurance than ever before in the history of chemistry.</div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Chemical Activity of Non-ionized Molecules.</h4>—The conclusion
reached, on the basis both of qualitative and, particularly,
of quantitative evidence, that the reactions of salts, acids and
bases (ionogens) in aqueous solutions (the so-called salt reactions)
are the actions of the ions and not of the non-ionized molecules,
does not necessarily mean that the non-ionized molecules are
altogether inactive chemically. Some chemists believe that ions
have only the advantage of an <em class="italic">enormously greater degree of reactivity</em>.<a id="FNanchor_144_149" href="#Footnote_144_149" class="fnanchor">144</a>
If the atoms in a molecule carry electric charges even
prior to their separation (ionization), as expressed for instance by
the formula H<sup>+</sup>Cl<sup>−</sup> for hydrogen chloride (p. <a href="#p043">43</a>), it can be readily
seen that an action<a id="FNanchor_145_150" href="#Footnote_145_150" class="fnanchor">145</a> resulting from the collision of a molecule of
hydrogen chloride with a molecule of potassium hydroxide H<sup>+</sup>Cl<sup>−</sup> +
HO<sup>−</sup>K<sup>+</sup> ⇄ K<sup>+</sup>Cl<sup>−</sup> + HO<sup>−</sup>H<sup>+</sup> would, in some respects, resemble
the ionic action H<sup>+</sup> + Cl<sup>−</sup> + K<sup>+</sup> + HO<sup>−</sup> ⇄ K<sup>+</sup> + Cl<sup>−</sup> + HOH.
The latter would probably have the advantage of a considerably
smaller resistance to the action, and consequently of a far greater
speed. <em class="italic">But the question of supreme importance and interest to chemistry
is the question as to which actions are found experimentally to be
of moment in any given case.</em> Now, a great mass of corroborative
evidence shows that for the interactions of ionogens in aqueous
solutions the ionic actions, probably on account of their enormous
speeds, <em class="italic">are the important ones</em>. <a id="p084" class="xxpn">[p084]</a></div>

<p>On the other hand, there are large numbers of compounds,
especially among organic substances, which do not appear to
ionize to a measurable extent and whose actions, in large part
at least, appear to be the actions of <em class="italic">non-ionized molecules</em>. It is
characteristic that most of these actions take place at <em class="italic">slow</em>, very
frequently easily measurable, rates of speed. Critical study
shows that even for such actions ionization often plays a very important
rôle, at least in some of their stages, and throughout the
field of organic chemistry the <em class="italic">intimate relations</em> between <em class="italic">electrical
phenomena and chemical activity can be readily recognized</em>.<a id="FNanchor_146_151" href="#Footnote_146_151" class="fnanchor">146</a> But
these relations are not obvious ones and do not, as yet, play a
dominant rôle. It is because analytical chemistry deals predominantly
with the reactions of <em class="italic">ionogens</em>, that the study of the <em class="italic">reactions
of ions</em> will demand our extended attention.</p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<div class="h4p"><h4>Reactions in Non-aqueous Solutions.</h4>—Kahlenberg<a id="FNanchor_147_152" href="#Footnote_147_152" class="fnanchor">147</a> has made some
interesting and important, although not conclusive, contributions to the
problem of chemical activity of ionogens in non-aqueous solutions. He has
found, for instance, that zinc, left in contact with a benzene solution of hydrogen
chloride carefully freed from moisture, displaces hydrogen.<a id="FNanchor_148_153" href="#Footnote_148_153" class="fnanchor">148</a> Cadmium,
aluminium and magnesium, on the other hand, do not evolve hydrogen in
such a solution.<a id="FNanchor_149_154" href="#Footnote_149_154" class="fnanchor">149</a> The solution shows an enormous resistance to the passage
of an electric current, and the conclusion is drawn by Kahlenberg that the
liberation of hydrogen is due to the action of non-ionized hydrogen chloride
on the zinc.</div>

<p>It is evident,<a id="FNanchor_150_155" href="#Footnote_150_155" class="fnanchor">150</a> from Walden's equation showing the relation between the
ionizing power and the dielectric constant of a solvent (p. <a href="#p063">63</a>), that the presumption
is that hydrogen chloride in benzene solution is not absolutely non-ionized,
but rather that it is ionized in traces.<a id="FNanchor_151_156" href="#Footnote_151_156" class="fnanchor">151</a> No exact measurements of the
<a id="p085" class="xxpn">[p085]</a> <em class="italic">degrees of ionization of hydrogen chloride in benzene solution</em> have been made;
that the solution shows an enormous resistance to the passage of the electric
current and can be, at best, very little ionized, is all that has been established.
In default of exact data, the semiquantitative determination by Kablukoff,
showing that a 0.25 molar solution of hydrogen chloride in benzene has a resistance
of 120 × 10<sup>6</sup> ohms, is of interest. From the meager data concerning the
dimensions of the electrodes used, one may calculate (with the aid of a not
unreasonable assumption as to the limiting value of the conductivity, at
infinite solution) that the degree of ionization of the acid in the solution is
perhaps of the order 5E−9, and the concentration of hydrogen-ion,<a id="FNanchor_152_157" href="#Footnote_152_157" class="fnanchor">152</a> consequently,
roughly 10<sup>−9</sup>. Now, the evolution of hydrogen by means of zinc,
in aqueous solutions, takes place according to the equation
Zn ↓, + 2 H<sup>+</sup> ⇄ Zn<sup>2+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub> ↑, and depends on a <em class="italic">ratio of the concentrations</em> of zinc-ion and hydrogen-ion<a id="FNanchor_153_158" href="#Footnote_153_158" class="fnanchor">153</a>
(Chapters XIV and XV, <em class="italic">q.v.</em>). Even if the concentration of
hydrogen-ion is very small, zinc will liberate hydrogen, provided the conditions
are such that the concentration of zinc-ion cannot reach a large enough value
to satisfy the equilibrium ratio, and stop the action. Now, in an alkaline
solution, zinc-ion is converted into zincate-ion (Zn<sup>2+</sup> + 4 HO<sup>−</sup> ⇄ ZnO<sub>2</sub><sup>2−</sup> + 2 HOH)
and a large concentration of zinc-ion cannot accumulate. The
consequence is that zinc liberates hydrogen freely even from alkaline solutions,
for instance from molar solutions of potassium hydroxide, in which the concentration
of hydrogen-ion, roughly 10<sup>−14</sup>, is <em class="italic">very much smaller</em> than that
calculated for the benzene solution of hydrogen chloride (namely, 10<sup>−9</sup>). Now,
although the values of the solution-tension constants of elements change
most decidedly with a change of solvent, it seems likely<a id="FNanchor_154_159" href="#Footnote_154_159" class="fnanchor">154</a> that their <em class="italic">ratios</em>,
on which their mutual displacement depends, will not be found materially altered.
Zinc chloride being insoluble in benzene, the ratio for equilibrium
may not be fulfilled for zinc in contact with a benzene solution of hydrogen
chloride. Hence, with that solvent, <em class="italic">the evolution of hydrogen may, so
far as it goes, very well be due to precisely the same machinery as that operating
in aqueous solution</em>. The liberation goes on until the metal is protected
against any further action by a film of the solid chloride. It seems, therefore,
at least possible, that the evolution of hydrogen observed by Kahlenberg
and his collaborators<a id="FNanchor_155_160" href="#Footnote_155_160" class="fnanchor">155</a> is a purely ionic action, the same as the similar
<a id="p086" class="xxpn">[p086]</a> action in aqueous solution has been proved to be by quantitative measurements.<a id="FNanchor_156_161" href="#Footnote_156_161" class="fnanchor">156</a>
Only exact measurements, comparable with those made in aqueous
solutions, can settle the question at issue, and until such quantitative evidence
is forthcoming, a definite conclusion that the action of hydrogen
chloride in benzene solution is or is not an ionic action is not warranted by
the facts.</p>

<p>Equally interesting are Kahlenberg's observations of interaction between
hydrogen chloride in benzene solution and a similar solution of copper oleate.
Each solution shows absence of appreciable conductivity, yet, when the solutions
are mixed, precipitation of copper chloride occurs instantly. Whether we
have here an instantaneous action between non-ionized molecules, as claimed
by the observer, or whether the minimal ionization<a id="FNanchor_157_162" href="#Footnote_157_162" class="fnanchor">157</a> of the hydrogen chloride
and copper oleate, the existence of which we have a right to assume, is sufficient
to account for this rapid action, both components being in solution and
intimately mixed, is a question of the greatest interest. But until quantitative
measurements of all the factors involved in chemical actions in benzene
solution are obtained, a very difficult, but necessary task, which the discoverer
of the action omitted to perform, no definite conclusion whatever
can be based on such results, interesting as they are. Water, although it is
only minimally ionized (tables, Chapter VI), hydrolyzes salts like potassium
cyanide and aluminium chloride almost instantly, and it has been rigorously
proved that the resulting condition of equilibrium involves the <em class="italic">ions of water</em><a id="FNanchor_158_163" href="#Footnote_158_163" class="fnanchor">158</a>
(Chapter X). With the possibility that the well-known enormous speeds of
action of ions may completely offset the tremendous reduction in concentration
of the hydrogen-ion, in a benzene solution of hydrogen chloride as
compared with an aqueous solution, further analysis of the relations is imperative.<a id="FNanchor_159_164" href="#Footnote_159_164" class="fnanchor">159</a>
Until such investigations have been carried out, we must consider
<a id="p087" class="xxpn">[p087]</a> it possible that the reactions of hydrogen chloride in benzene solution may be
reactions of its non-ionized molecules or reactions of its ions. In view of
the undoubted minute concentrations of the latter, as compared with aqueous
solutions, and in view of the inertness of non-ionized hydrogen chloride in
aqueous solutions as compared with the activity of its ions, a benzene solution
of hydrogen chloride should show far less ionic activity than an aqueous
solution, and that such is the case is brought out clearly by Kahlenberg's
interesting experiments.</p></div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Some Applications of the Chemical Activity of Ions to Qualitative
Analysis.</h4>—The knowledge that aqueous solutions of
ionogens show the reactions of the ions contained in them, gives
us a clear, sharply defined interpretation of many of the simpler
facts of qualitative analysis. The elementary observation that a
large number of hydrogen derivatives show acid properties and a
considerable number of others do not (at least not to a sufficient
extent to be appreciable), finds its simplest explanation in the
fact that all solutions showing acid properties have these properties
as the result of the presence of a common component, namely
the hydrogen-ion. The acid properties are, in fact, the properties
of this one substance and no other. Thus hydrochloric, nitric,
sulphuric, carbonic acids are acids because they are dissociated
more or less, liberating hydrogen ions; and compounds like marsh-gas
CH<sub>4</sub>, ammonia NH<sub>3</sub>, benzene C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, in spite of the presence
of a great deal of hydrogen in their molecules, are not
acids, because they do not, to an appreciable extent,<a id="FNanchor_160_165" href="#Footnote_160_165" class="fnanchor">160</a> ionize as
do the first compounds mentioned. In the same way, glycerine
C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>(OH)<sub>3</sub>, although it is a trihydroxide, does not show the characteristic
actions of the hydroxides of potassium, barium, aluminium,
of the metal hydroxides in general—the latter are more or
less ionized, forming the characteristic ion of bases, the hydroxide-ion
HO<sup>−</sup>; but glycerine does not appear to ionize into C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub><sup>3+</sup>
and HO<sup>−</sup>. The well-known observation of qualitative analysis,
that potassium chlorate solutions do not precipitate silver chloride
from silver nitrate, while potassium chloride and other chlorides
do so at once, is now understood as being the result of the fact that
the chlorates produce the chlorate-ion ClO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> (see page <a href="#p070">70</a> for the
method of determining its composition), while the chloride-ion
<a id="p088" class="xxpn">[p088]</a> is required for the precipitation of silver chloride. Chlorplatinic
acid H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub>, in spite of the large proportion of chlorine in its
composition, does not precipitate silver chloride, but rather silver
chlorplatinate,<a id="FNanchor_161_166" href="#Footnote_161_166" class="fnanchor">161</a> a yellow salt, insoluble in ammonia, and it does so
because its ions<a id="FNanchor_162_167" href="#Footnote_162_167" class="fnanchor">162</a> are H<sup>+</sup> and (PtCl<sub>6</sub><sup>2−</sup>).</div>

<p>Perhaps the most instructive case of this kind, that we can study,
is that of iron in ferrous and ferric salts. Exceedingly sensitive
tests are known for the ferrous and the ferric ions. Thiocyanates
produce an intensely red salt, Fe(SCN)<sub>3</sub>, when added, for
instance, to <em class="italic">ferric</em> chloride; potassium ferrocyanide, K<sub>4</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>,
precipitates ferric ferrocyanide, Fe<sub>4</sub>[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sub>3</sub>, Prussian blue, from
ferric chloride solutions; ammonium hydroxide precipitates quantitatively
the insoluble red ferric hydroxide (exps.). With <em class="italic">ferrous</em>
salts, potassium ferricyanide K<sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub> precipitates ferro-ferricyanide
Fe<sub>3</sub>[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sub>2</sub>, Turnbull's blue; ammonium sulphide precipitates
black ferrous sulphide (<em class="italic">exps.</em>). Now, in two of the
reagents used, potassium ferro- and ferricyanide, iron is present
according to the formulæ given. If one should attempt to demonstrate
its presence by means of these tests—among the most
sensitive and most reliable tests known in analysis—one would
fail utterly. Thiocyanates do not produce even the faintest tinge
of pink in potassium ferricyanide solution<a id="FNanchor_163_168" href="#Footnote_163_168" class="fnanchor">163</a>; ammonium hydroxide
does not precipitate any ferric hydroxide (<em class="italic">exps.</em>). Ammonium
sulphide does not precipitate the least trace of a black sulphide
from a ferrocyanide solution, and when the latter is mixed with
the ferricyanide solution, no trace, either of Prussian or Turnbull's
blue, is shown (<em class="italic">exps.</em>). The contrast between the behavior of these
salts and ferrous and ferric salts is now sharply and definitely
interpreted, as being the result of the contrast in their ionization,—the
color tests we use are extremely sensitive tests only for the
<em class="italic">ferric</em> and <em class="italic">ferrous ions</em>, Fe<sup>3+</sup> and Fe<sup>2+</sup>, respectively,—but potassium
ferrocyanide ionizes into potassium ions and the negative
ferrocyanide ions Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub><sup>4−</sup>, and shows the actions of ferrous
ions as little as chlorate ions ClO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> exhibit the reactions of
chloride ions Cl<sup>−</sup>. Potassium ferricyanide, in turn, gives rise to
trivalent, negative ferricyanide ions Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub><sup>3−</sup> and not to ferric
<a id="p089" class="xxpn">[p089]</a> ions.<a id="FNanchor_164_169" href="#Footnote_164_169" class="fnanchor">164</a> If any doubts arise on this point, one can decide the
question readily by experiment. When a concentrated solution of
potassium ferricyanide is placed in a U-tube under a solution of
some colorless electrolyte, such as sodium sulphate, and plates connected
with a battery are inserted, there is no difficulty (<em class="italic">exp.</em>) in
seeing that the yellow ion,<a id="FNanchor_165_170" href="#Footnote_165_170" class="fnanchor">165</a> containing the iron, moves to the <em class="italic">positive</em>
pole and <em class="italic">not</em> to the <em class="italic">negative</em>. The iron is, therefore, as a matter
of experiment, <em class="italic">part of a negatively charged substance</em>.</p>

<p>That iron is really present in these compounds can be shown
most effectively if we destroy the salts:</p>

The term "acid ion" is used to designate the "acid radical," when it
exists, in solution, as an independent charged particle or ion. "Acid ion"
is thus a convenient synonym for anion, just as "metal ion," designating the
metal or metal-like radical of a salt, is used as a synonym for cation. The
term, acid ion, has been found to convey more quickly and definitely to the
student's mind, than does the term anion, which component of an acid or salt
is referred to. While it is not, in some respects, an ideal term, yet its use
seems justified by its very close relation to the term "acid radical" and by its
practical advantages.</p></div>

The formation of an ammonium salt in the latter action still further
reduces the concentration of the hydroxide-ion (Chapter VI) and retards the
action; but the solution, in equal measure, becomes less active toward the indicator,
phenolphthaleïn (p. <a href="#p114">114</a>). The experiment shows, therefore, rather
fairly, the relative activities of the bases. The exact work of Arrhenius
included consideration of the effect of the ammonium salt, and the clearing

Arrhenius, <em class="italic">Electro-chemistry</em>, p. 184 (1902). A second accelerative factor,
the so-called "salt effect" (Chap. VI, <em class="italic">q. v.</em>), is more pronounced in the case of
0.1 molar hydrochloric acid than in that of 0.1 molar acetic acid, as the result
of which the activity of the hydrochloric acid should be increased about ten
per cent; the ratio, therefore, of the speeds of reaction, both the degrees of
ionization of the acids and the "salt effect" being considered, should be approximately
83 : 1, whereas the ratio found by experiment is 79 : 1.</p></div>

In a 0.1 molar solution of potassium cyanide, the potassium hydroxide
formed by the decomposition of the cyanide by water is approximately 0.0013
molar and the concentration of hydrogen-ion is reduced to 10<sup>−11</sup> (Chapter X),
a value roughly of the same order as that calculated above as a possible concentration
of hydrogen-ion in a benzene solution of hydrogen chloride. In
spite of this small concentration of hydrogen-ion in the cyanide solution,
the reactions in which it is involved are, as far as known, completed in a few
moments. Only for much smaller concentrations of ions have any doubts
as to their <em class="italic">direct action</em> been aroused; in Chapter XII this question, as raised by
Haber, is discussed for concentrations of ions of the order of 10<sup>−23</sup>. Haber

<p>The theory of ionization, as studied so far, gives us
simple, rational explanations of many of our qualitative
reactions—explanations which agree with phenomena taken from
separate fields of investigation. But, if our study of the theory
ceased at the present stage without further elaboration, we should
fail to find in it a satisfactory explanation of a number of other
important facts of analysis—notably, why certain reactions, the
occurrence of which we might anticipate, <em class="italic">do not
take place</em>. For instance, the addition of a soluble carbonate
to a barium chloride solution precipitates almost all the barium
as barium carbonate (<em class="italic">exp.</em>); we have
<span class="ibnowrap">2 Na<sup>+</sup> + CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup> + Ba<sup>2+</sup> + 2 Cl<sup>−</sup> →</span> <span class="ibnowrap">BaCO<sub>3</sub> ↓ +
2 Na<sup>+</sup> + 2 Cl<sup>−</sup>.</span> But the addition of
carbonic acid to barium chloride solutions fails to produce
the slightest precipitate (<em class="italic">exp.</em>),
although carbonic acid also gives rise to the carbonate-ion,
CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup>. In the same way silver nitrate
readily precipitates silver phosphate from sodium phosphate
solutions (<em class="italic">exp.</em>), but not from a
solution of phosphoric acid (<em class="italic">exp.</em>).
Hydrogen sulphide precipitates zinc sulphide from a
zinc sulphate solution (<em class="italic">exp.</em>),
<span class="ibnowrap">Zn<sup>2+</sup> + SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> +</span>
<span class="ibnowrap">2 H<sup>+</sup> + S<sup>2−</sup> →</span> <span class="ibnowrap">ZnS ↓ + 2 H<sup>+</sup> + SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>;</span>
but the addition of hydrochloric acid effectually prevents the
precipitation (<em class="italic">exp.</em>), although the hydrogen
sulphide is still ionized, as is apparent from the precipitation of
copper sulphide when copper sulphate is added to the mixture (<em
class="italic">exp.</em>). In the negative results, we have instances
of a very large number of cases which require closer study, and a
further development of the theory, if we wish to interpret them
satisfactorily. The line of development to be followed is indicated
perhaps most sharply by the following experiment.</p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p><em class="smcap">Exp.</em> Some sodium tetraborate (borax) is dissolved in a little water and
silver nitrate is added to a small part of the solution. A pure <em class="italic">white</em> precipitate
(silver borate) results. Another portion of the borate solution is diluted with
a <em class="italic">large quantity of water</em>, and then silver nitrate is added; quite a different result
is obtained—a <em class="italic">brown</em> precipitate (silver oxide) is formed. <a id="p091" class="xxpn">[p091]</a></p></div>

<p>The change in the quantity of water brought about the difference
in result—the <em class="italic">quantitative</em> relations were altered thereby. In
order to follow intelligently this and the other actions referred to,
the study of reactions in solutions must be taken up from the
<em class="italic">quantitative side</em>—the development heretofore has been essentially
qualitative in character. On several occasions we have found
that all electrolytes do not ionize equally well, and that the intensity
of their action, demonstrated, for instance, for potassium and
ammonium hydroxides, varies accordingly. We shall now have
to study these relations in greater detail.</p>

<p>For our purpose, the study of two of the fundamental quantitative
laws governing action in solution and of their application to
analytical phenomena, will be sufficient: these are, <em class="italic">the law of chemical
or homogeneous equilibrium</em>, in which the <em class="italic">law of mass action</em> is
included, and the law of <em class="italic">physical</em> or <em class="italic">heterogeneous equilibrium</em>.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Law of Chemical Equilibrium.</h4>—The law of chemical
equilibrium may be expressed, for a simple case, by saying that if
two substances <em class="italic">A</em> and <em class="italic">B</em> interact at a constant temperature to

each other to produce <em class="italic">A</em> and <em class="italic">B</em>, then equilibrium will be reached

the product of the concentrations of</em> <em class="italic">C</em> <em class="italic">and of</em> <em class="italic">D</em> <em class="italic">has a definite, constant

for equilibrium may be expressed in the mathematical equation</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">

<p class="continue">[<em class="italic">A</em>], [<em

the four reacting substances and <em class="italic">k</em> is some
definite number, called the equilibrium constant.</p>

<p>The law was discovered by Guldberg and Waage in 1867, and,
with certain limiting conditions (see below) it has been fully established
by extensive experimental work.<a id="FNanchor_167_190" href="#Footnote_167_190" class="fnanchor">167</a> The significance of the
law may be interpreted on the basis of the following considerations.
If we start with the two substances <em class="italic">A</em> and <em class="italic">B</em> alone and
have one mole of each in one liter (as gas or in solution) at a
given temperature, then, all the conditions being given,—the
temperature, the concentrations, and the nature of the substances,—the
reaction <em class="italic">A</em> + <em class="italic">B</em> → <em class="italic">C</em> + <em class="italic">D</em>, leading to the formation of <em class="italic">C</em> and
<em class="italic">D</em>, <em class="italic">will proceed with a perfectly definite velocity</em>. The molecules of
<em class="italic">A</em> and of <em class="italic">B</em> move in all directions (kinetic theory of gases and
solutions), and molecules of <em class="italic">A</em> will collide with molecules of <em class="italic">B</em> a
definite number of times in unit time and will form a definite
number<a id="FNanchor_168_191" href="#Footnote_168_191" class="fnanchor">168</a> of molecules of <em class="italic">C</em> and <em class="italic">D</em> per minute. The velocity of
chemical change of a given substance (<em class="italic">chemical velocity</em>) is also
measured in terms of moles, and is represented by the number
of moles or the fraction of a mole changed per minute. If <em class="italic">v′</em><sub>1</sub>
stands for the velocity of the action between <em class="italic">A</em> and <em class="italic">B</em>, under the
given conditions, then</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
<em class="italic">v′</em><sub>1</sub> = <em class="italic">k</em><sub>1</sub>,
</div></div>

<p class="continue">where <em class="italic">k</em><sub>1</sub> is some number. Now, if the concentration of one of
the components, <em class="italic">e.g.</em> <em class="italic">A</em>, should be doubled, then the chances for
collision and for action between molecules of <em class="italic">A</em> and <em class="italic">B</em> will be twice
as great as before and the velocity of the action will be doubled.
If only one-tenth of the concentration of <em class="italic">A</em> (one-tenth mole) is
used, the velocity will only be one-tenth as great as originally, and,
in general terms, if [<em class="italic">A</em>] moles of <em class="italic">A</em> are used per liter, the <em class="italic">velocity of
the change will be proportional to</em> [<em class="italic">A</em>], <em class="italic">and equal to</em> <em class="italic">k</em><sub>1</sub> × [<em class="italic">A</em>]. If the
concentration of the other reacting component, <em class="italic">B</em>, is now doubled,
the chances for action are again doubled, and, in general, the
velocity of the action will be proportional also to the concentration
<a id="p093" class="xxpn">[p093]</a> [<em class="italic">B</em>] of the second reacting substance. For the velocity, <em class="italic">v</em><sub>1</sub> of the
action for any concentrations, [<em class="italic">A</em>] and [<em class="italic">B</em>], of <em class="italic">A</em> and <em class="italic">B</em> at any

The case is an instance of the <em class="italic">law of mass action, which

<p class="continue">the relation may be developed in the same way. Thus the two

<p class="continue">In this way the meaning of the fundamental law of chemical

<p>The mechanical significance of the raised powers of the concentrations
of components, two or more molecules of which take
part in a reaction as indicated, will be discussed further on, in
connection with a case of equilibrium between an electrolyte and
its ions (Chapter VI, p. <a href="#p102">102</a>).</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Limitations to the Law of Chemical Equilibrium.</h4>—Quite in agreement
with the interpretation of the law of chemical equilibrium from the view-point
of the kinetic theory, it is found that, in its applications, one must take into
consideration the possibility, that molecular attractions (p. <a href="#p027">27</a>) or other important
forces of attraction or repulsion (<em class="italic">e.g.</em> electrical) of a more than <em class="italic">negligible</em>
magnitude exist between the molecules of the components in a reversible reaction.
If such forces are involved, suitable allowance must be made for them,
so that the mathematical formulation of the law may express the facts of
observation.<a id="FNanchor_174_197" href="#Footnote_174_197" class="fnanchor">174</a> For these reasons, the law, in its simplest terms, which, alone,
can be considered here, holds for the relations <em class="italic">obtaining in dilute systems</em><a id="FNanchor_175_198" href="#Footnote_175_198" class="fnanchor">175</a>
(dilute solutions or gases that are not too strongly compressed), and in <em class="italic">systems
involving only nonelectrolytes or only weak ionogens</em>, more generally than for
the relations in concentrated solutions (or strongly compressed gases) or in
systems, in which electrically charged particles (ions) are present in large proportions
(see below, p. <a href="#p108">108</a>).</div></div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Factors of the Law of Chemical Equilibrium.</h4>—Inspection
of the mathematical expression of the law of chemical equilibrium
(p. <a href="#p091">91</a>) shows that there are two significant kinds of factors in it:
first, the equilibrium <em class="italic">constant</em>, whose value depends only on the
nature of the substances involved and on the temperature.<a id="FNanchor_176_199" href="#Footnote_176_199" class="fnanchor">176</a> In
<a id="p096" class="xxpn">[p096]</a> the second place, we have concentration factors, which, to a large
extent,<a id="FNanchor_177_200" href="#Footnote_177_200" class="fnanchor">177</a> may be varied at will.</div>

<p>The following experiments may be used to illustrate the significance
of the two classes of factors: Phosphorus pentabromide
is partially decomposed by heat into the tribromide and bromine
(a case of gaseous dissociation):</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
PBr<sub>5</sub> ⇄ PBr<sub>3</sub> + Br<sub>2</sub>.
</div></div>

<p class="continue">Phosphorus trichlordibromide is decomposed more or less, in a
similar fashion, into the components phosphorus trichloride and
bromine, according to the equation</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
PCl<sub>3</sub>Br<sub>2</sub> ⇄ PCl<sub>3</sub> + Br<sub>2</sub>.

<span class="ibnowrap">[PBr<sub>3</sub>] × [Br<sub>2</sub>]′ / [PBr<sub>5</sub>] = <em class="italic">k</em><sub>1</sub>
<br />
and [PCl<sub>3</sub>] × [Br<sub>2</sub>]″ / [PCl<sub>3</sub>Br<sub>2</sub>] = <em class="italic">k</em><sub>2</sub>.

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p><em class="smcap">Exp.</em> Two tubes containing equivalent quantities of the two bromides
are placed side by side in warm water.<a id="FNanchor_178_201" href="#Footnote_178_201" class="fnanchor">178</a> The tube containing the trichlordibromide
is found to be much more intensely colored by free bromine than
that containing the pentabromide.</p></div>

<p>The intensity of the color of the bromine vapor shows that the
concentration of bromine, [Br<sub>2</sub>]″, in the PCl<sub>3</sub>Br<sub>2</sub> tube, is <em class="italic">greater
than the corresponding concentration</em>, [Br<sub>2</sub>]′, in the PBr<sub>5</sub> tube. As
a molecule of pentahalide PX<sub>5</sub> dissociates into one molecule of
PX<sub>3</sub> and one molecule of X<sub>2</sub>, [PCl<sub>3</sub>] equals [Br<sub>2</sub>]″ and is <em class="italic">greater</em>
than [PBr<sub>3</sub>], which is equal to [Br<sub>2</sub>]′. Further, more of the pentabromide
than of the trichlordibromide must be left undecomposed,
<em class="italic">i.e.</em> [PCl<sub>3</sub>Br<sub>2</sub>] is <em class="italic">smaller</em> than PBr<sub>5</sub>. Since the factors in the
<em class="italic">numerator</em> of the second equation are <em class="italic">both larger</em>, and the factor in
the <em class="italic">denominator smaller, than the corresponding factors</em> in the first
equation, <em class="italic">k</em><sub>2</sub> <em class="italic">must be greater than</em> <em class="italic">k</em><sub>1</sub>. These <em class="italic">constants</em> are thus seen
to be a <em class="italic">measure</em> of the <em class="italic">chemical stability</em> of these pentahalides.
It is evident, too, that in reactions which depend on the presence
of free bromine, such as the bromination of many organic compounds,
the trichlordibromide should be more <em class="italic">effective</em> than the
equivalent quantity of the pentabromide. <a id="p097" class="xxpn">[p097]</a></p>

<p>In the second place, if we were to introduce into either tube,
for instance into the tube containing the phosphorus trichlordibromide,
an <em class="italic">excess of one of the dissociation products</em>, say an excess

owing to the suppression of free bromine.<a id="FNanchor_179_202" href="#Footnote_179_202" class="fnanchor">179</a></p></div>

<p>The concentration of the free bromine, ([Br<sub>2</sub>]′ − <em class="italic">x</em>), under the
new conditions of equilibrium, is smaller than the original concentration

of the system;</em> for instance, for brominating purposes, the new
system would be less effective than the original one, and it might
be of especial service where bromination is to be avoided.</p>

<p>In the cases studied, are found the two fundamentally important
relations expressed by the law of equilibrium: <em class="italic">the equilibrium
constant is a measure of the stability of a certain system</em> and, in a
way, of its <em class="italic">reactivity</em> at a given temperature; and the
<a id="p098" class="xxpn">[p098]</a> <em class="italic">concentration
factors are variables</em>, which we may change to a very considerable
extent, so as, to a certain degree, to subject the system to our
own purposes. We shall repeatedly have occasion to refer to
these two fundamental relations and we shall use them again and
again in our analytical work.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Chemical Equilibrium of Electrolytes.</h4>—Ionization of an
electrolyte is a reversible chemical action and its relation to the
law of chemical equilibrium will now be discussed. For acetic
acid, ionization into hydrogen and acetate ions occurs thus:
<span class="ibnowrap">CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H ⇄</span> <span class="ibnowrap">CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> + H<sup>+</sup>,</span> and, in accordance with the law of
equilibrium, at a given temperature, the following relation would
hold:</div>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
[H<sup>+</sup>] × [CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>] / [CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H] = K<sub>ionization</sub>.
</div></div>

<p class="continue">If the total concentration of the acid is known, the concentrations
of the ions and of the non-ionized acid may be calculated from the
conductivity of the solution. For instance, if 60 grams of acetic
acid (1 mole) is dissolved in sufficient water to make 10 liters,
the equivalent conductivity of the solution (p. <a href="#p050">50</a>) is found to be
4.67 reciprocal ohms at 18°. The maximum conductivity of one
mole of acetic acid, at infinite dilution, when all the acid would be
ionized, would be 347. Therefore, in the acid under examination,
4.67 / 347, or 1.34 per cent, is ionized (p. <a href="#p050">50</a>). Since the total
concentration of the acid is 0.1 mole <em class="italic">per liter</em> and 1.34 per cent is
ionized, the concentration of the hydrogen-ion, [H<sup>+</sup>], is 0.1 × 0.0134,
and that of the acetate-ion, [CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>], is the same. The concentration
of the non-ionized acetic acid, [CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H], is 0.1 × 0.9866.
If these values are inserted in the equation for the condition
of equilibrium, we have</p>

</div></div>

<p>From this experimental result, the equilibrium constant, which is
called the <em class="italic">ionization constant</em> of the acid, is found to have the value
18.2E−6. If the ratio [H<sup>+</sup>] × [CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>] / [CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H] really is a
constant, the same value, within the limits of experimental errors,
should be obtained from acetic acid in other concentrations. Now,
if the above solution is diluted to ten times its volume, the concentration
of the acid is made 0.01 mole <em class="italic">per liter</em>, the conductivity
<a id="p099" class="xxpn">[p099]</a> is found to have increased to 14.5 reciprocal ohms, and the percentage
of ionized acid is then 14.5 / 347, or 4.17. Here, [H<sup>+</sup>] and
[CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>] = 0.01 × 0.0417 and [CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H] = 0.01 × 0.9583. Inserting
these values in our general equation and calculating the
result, we obtain 18.1E−6 as the value of the constant. In the
following table<a id="FNanchor_180_203" href="#Footnote_180_203" class="fnanchor">180</a> are given the molar conductivities, Λ (column 2),
of acetic acid of varying concentrations, <em class="italic">m</em> (column 1). The degrees
of ionization, α, and the ionization constant, calculated according

<p>It is evident, that a constant value is found for the ratio
[H<sup>+</sup>] × [CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>] / [CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H]
and that the ionization of acetic acid,
in these dilute solutions, obeys the law of chemical equilibrium.<a id="FNanchor_181_204" href="#Footnote_181_204" class="fnanchor">181</a>
The equilibrium constant expresses in definite, quantitative terms
the tendency of acetic acid to ionize in dilute solution. Examination
of other acids shows that there is an enormous range in the
values found for their respective ionization constants. The constants
are the best <em class="italic">measure</em> of the <em class="italic">strength</em> of the <em class="italic">acids</em> as acids.
Obviously, the more readily acids in equivalent solutions ionize,
the greater will be the concentration of the hydrogen-ion to which
the characteristic acid properties are due, and the more pronounced
(stronger) will be the exhibition of these properties.
From the ionization constants one may calculate, for instance,
the proportion in which two competing acids will neutralize a
base, when the latter is used in quantity insufficient to neutralize
both acids. <a id="p100" class="xxpn">[p100]</a></p>

<p>Inspection of the equation for acetic acid, which is the typical
equilibrium equation for all <em class="italic">monobasic</em> acids, shows that the greater
the degrees of ionization of acids are in equivalent solutions, <em class="italic">i.e.</em>
the greater the concentrations of the hydrogen-ion which their
ionization produces in equivalent solutions, the larger will be the
values of their ionization constants. The acids with the <em class="italic">larger</em>
constants are, then, the <em class="italic">stronger</em> acids.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Ionization of Various Acids.</h4>—The table
given on page <a href="#p104">104</a> shows the ionization constants for a number of
acids of interest in analysis. Before proceeding to give the table,
we must consider further two important points.</div>

<p>In the first place, for the strongest acids, such as hydrochloric,
nitric, hydrobromic and similar acids, chemists have been unable
to determine ionization constants on the basis of the law of chemical
equilibrium. Strong acids, strong bases and most salts (see
pp. <a href="#p106">106</a>–<a href="#p108">8</a>, below),
the three classes comprising <em class="italic">all</em> the <em class="italic">very readily
ionizable electrolytes, do not give constants</em> when the values of the
equilibrium ratio,<a id="FNanchor_182_205" href="#Footnote_182_205" class="fnanchor">182</a>
[Cation] × [Anion] / [Molecules], are calculated for
different concentrations, and <em class="italic">they therefore do not ionize simply in
accordance with the law of chemical equilibrium</em>. The reasons for
this abnormal behavior will be discussed presently (p. <a href="#p108">108</a>), when
other necessary facts are before us. In order to have, at least, a
rough basis for comparison of these strong acids with the weak
ones, which do obey the law of chemical equilibrium, the table
will give for the strong acids <em class="italic">the value of the above ratio as calculated
from their ionization in 0.1 molar solutions</em>.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Ionization of Polybasic Acids.</h4>—In the second place,
the meaning of the <em class="italic">constants for polybasic acids</em>, such as sulphuric,
phosphoric, carbonic and similar acids, requires explanation.
The relations for carbonic acid will be first developed, as representing
a typical case. Carbonic acid, in ionizing, forms the
carbonate-ion CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup>, and the hydrogen-ion, as expressed in the
<a id="p101" class="xxpn">[p101]</a> equation<a id="FNanchor_183_206" href="#Footnote_183_206" class="fnanchor">183</a> H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> ⇄ 2 H<sup>+</sup> + CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup>. According to the law of chemical
equilibrium for the case where a product (here the hydrogen-ion)
appears twice on one side of the reaction equation, we have,
for the condition of equilibrium (p. <a href="#p094">94</a>)</div>

</div>
<div class="equationlabel">(1)</div>
</div>

<p class="continue">We may ask, however, whether both the hydrogen atoms of
carbonic acid show the <em class="italic">same tendency to ionize</em>, or, since there is
a vast difference in the ease of ionization of different acids, whether
there is not also a difference in the ease of ionization of the different
hydrogen atoms in a polybasic acid. As a matter of experiment,
we find that a molecule of carbonic acid does ionize, first,
and more readily, into one hydrogen ion and an <em class="italic">acid carbonate</em>
ion HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, according to H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> ⇄ H<sup>+</sup> + HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>.</p>

<p>The acid carbonate-ion HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, in turn, is ionized to a certain

<p class="continue">This is equation (1), derived originally by the application of the
law of mass action to the relation between the carbonate-ion,
CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup>, the hydrogen-ion, and carbonic acid, H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>This relation, and, in particular, the <em class="italic">significant squaring</em> of the
concentration of the hydrogen-ion, an ion which appears <em class="italic">twice</em> in the
equation for the formation of carbonic acid from carbonate and
hydrogen ions, (2 H<sup>+</sup> + CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup> ⇄ H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), may now be interpreted
mechanically (p. <a href="#p092">92</a>) as follows: For the formation of carbonic acid
from a carbonate ion and <em class="italic">two</em> hydrogen ions, a carbonate ion must
collide and combine first with one hydrogen ion, and the velocity
for the formation of this intermediate product, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, will be
proportional to the (total) concentration of the hydrogen ions;
the product, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, to form H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, must collide and combine with
a hydrogen ion once more, and this combination will proceed with
a velocity <em class="italic">again proportional</em> to the (total) concentration of the
hydrogen ions. So the velocity for the transformation of CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup> into
H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> will be proportional <em class="italic">twice over</em> to the (total) concentration
of the hydrogen ions—as well as, in the usual fashion, to the
concentration of the carbonate ions present at any moment.</p>

<p><em class="italic">It is a general principle that the primary ionization of polyvalent
acids occurs more readily than the secondary</em>, and this in turn more
readily than the tertiary (if a third ionizable hydrogen atom is
present in the acid).</p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p>In the case of phosphoric acid, for instance, the primary ionization into the
hydrogen-ion and the dihydrogen-phosphate-ion, H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup>, takes place so
readily that phosphoric acid reacts strongly acid<a id="FNanchor_187_210" href="#Footnote_187_210" class="fnanchor">187</a> to methyl orange,<a id="FNanchor_188_211" href="#Footnote_188_211" class="fnanchor">188</a> the
<a id="p103" class="xxpn">[p103]</a> concentration of hydrogen-ion being sufficiently great to affect this indicator
(see <em class="smcap">Exp.</em> below).</p>

<p>When phosphoric acid is neutralized by one equivalent of a base, say of
sodium hydroxide, the salt formed, sodium dihydrogen-phosphate, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>,
yields sodium-ion and dihydrogen-phosphate-ion, H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup>. The latter is
ionized <em class="italic">somewhat</em> into H<sup>+</sup> and the bivalent hydrogen-phosphate-ion, HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>.
The ionization of the ion H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup> is now the chief source of supply of
hydrogen-ion (the further ionization of HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> is practically negligible here)
and it is ionized so little that the solution of NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> no longer changes the
color of methyl orange (see <em class="smcap">Exp.</em> below). The solution is, however, acid to
the indicator phenolphthaleïn, which is much more sensitive to the hydrogen-ion
and will show the presence of much smaller concentrations of it than will
methyl orange. The addition of a second equivalent of sodium hydroxide
to the solution converts NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> into Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>. This salt gives sodium-ion
and the hydrogen-phosphate-ion HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>, which, in turn, is ionized only
very slightly, producing phosphate-ion PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup>, and again hydrogen-ion.
The ionization of HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> is so slight, however, and the concentration of the
hydrogen-ion, therefore, so minute, that the solution does not react acid even
to the sensitive indicator phenolphthaleïn.</p>

<p><em class="smcap">Exp.</em> Methyl orange (very little) is added to 10 c.c. of a 0.1 molar solution
of phosphoric acid and 10 c.c. of 0.1 molar sodium hydroxide solution
is added to the mixture; the color will be found to change from the acid to
the neutral tint just as the last drop or two of the alkali are added. Phenolphthaleïn
is then added to the mixture and 10 c.c. more of the 0.1 molar
sodium hydroxide solution are required to change the color of the mixture to
a pronounced pink (alkaline) tint.</p>

<p>Even sulphuric acid, although its two hydrogen atoms are ionized very
easily, making sulphuric acid a strong acid, shows a difference in the ease
of ionization of the two hydrogen atoms. Since ionization, in general, is
favored by dilution, we find that in the case of such a strong acid the difference
is most marked in more concentrated solutions, the smaller amount of
water starting the ionization in the more favored direction and producing first,
chiefly, hydrogen-sulphate ions, HSO<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup>. When the solution is diluted, the hydrogen-sulphate
ions are to a very considerable extent dissociated into sulphate
ions and hydrogen ions. The described change in ionization can be roughly
followed with the aid of an insoluble sulphate like barium sulphate. Barium
sulphate, while very insoluble in water, dissolves in rather strong sulphuric
acid to form the acid sulphate, Ba(HSO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, the SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> ion of the sulphate

<p>The difference in the tendencies of acids to ionize, as expressed
in the table, may be recognized in equivalent solutions by any
of the properties dependent on the ionization, such as the conductivity,
the chemical activity, the osmotic pressure and allied
effects, and so forth. If the conductivities of equal volumes of
equivalent (<em class="italic">e.g.</em> normal) solutions of hydrochloric, phosphoric and
acetic acids are compared (<em class="italic">exp.</em>)<a id="FNanchor_190_213" href="#Footnote_190_213" class="fnanchor">190</a>, it is readily seen that hydrochloric
acid is the best conductor, phosphoric acid a much poorer
one, and acetic acid an exceedingly poor one (the conductivity of
normal acetic acid is about 1 / 200 that of normal hydrochloric acid,
and the conductivity of normal phosphoric acid is about 1 / 14 that
of normal hydrochloric acid). Since the conductivity is approximately
proportional to the concentration of the hydrogen-ion<a id="FNanchor_191_214" href="#Footnote_191_214" class="fnanchor">191</a> in
each of the solutions, it is evident that the hydrochloric acid is
ionized to a considerably greater extent than either of the other
acids—than acetic acid, in particular. Similarly, if a drop (0.05
c.c.) of molar hydrochloric acid and a drop of molar acetic acid are
added to equal volumes (50 c.c.) of a very dilute solution of
methyl orange (<em class="italic">exp.</em>), the color will be changed decidedly by the
hydrochloric acid to a bright pink, but by the acetic acid only to
an orange hue. Again, if a precipitate of barium chromate or calcium
oxalate is treated with some strong acid, hydrochloric or
nitric, for instance, it dissolves readily, while a considerable excess
of acetic acid (<em class="italic">exp.</em>) only dissolves traces of either precipitate.<a id="FNanchor_192_215" href="#Footnote_192_215" class="fnanchor">192</a> In
this way, the chemical behavior of these acids differs in degree, as
a result of the different tendencies to ionize, which are expressed
in the constants of the table. Advantage is taken, in analysis, of
such differences. Acetic acid, for instance, is used when only a
slight degree of acidity is desired—as in recognizing barium-ion by
its chromate, or oxalic acid by means of its calcium salt. Hydrochloric
or nitric acid is used when decided acidity is required—as
in the separation of groups by hydrogen sulphide (Chap. XI).</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Ionization of Bases.</h4>—The same
relations hold for bases as for acids: the weaker bases give
ionization constants as <a id="p106" class="xxpn">[p106]</a> do
the weaker acids; the strong bases, again, as was mentioned above,
do not give constants. The values for strong bases, stated in the
following table, are bracketed, and refer to the ionization in 0.1
molar solutions of the bases. Polyvalent bases, like polybasic acids,
ionize in stages, and the primary ionization is usually stronger
than the secondary ionization, and so forth. For instance, a study
of ferric chloride solution shows that the third hydroxide group
of ferric hydroxide, Fe(OH)<sub>3</sub>, must have the smallest
ionization constant.<a id="FNanchor_193_216" href="#Footnote_193_216"

<p>While the constants of a large number of organic bases<a id="FNanchor_194_217" href="#Footnote_194_217" class="fnanchor">194</a> have
been determined few constants of inorganic bases are as yet
known. The fact that the majority of <em class="italic">inorganic bases</em> are polyvalent
and difficultly soluble has made their examination in this
respect more difficult. From the study of the decomposition of
salts by water (see Chapter X), the trivalent bases, such as
<a id="p107" class="xxpn">[p107]</a> ferric hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide, are found to be much
weaker than bivalent bases like cadmium, zinc and lead hydroxides,<a id="FNanchor_195_218" href="#Footnote_195_218" class="fnanchor">195</a>
but the data are not sufficient for the calculation of any constants,
or for distinguishing between the ionization of the first,
second and third hydroxide groups.</p>

<p>The difference in ionization and in chemical activity between
a strong base, like sodium or potassium hydroxide, and a weak
base, like ammonium hydroxide, has already been discussed and
illustrated (see p. <a href="#p077">77</a>). In analysis, advantage is frequently taken
of these relations.<a id="FNanchor_196_219" href="#Footnote_196_219" class="fnanchor">196</a></p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Ionization of Salts.</h4>—While we read and hear a good
deal about strong and weak acids, and strong and weak bases, the
expression "strong" or "weak" salt is never heard; as a matter
of fact, all salts, with very few exceptions, ionize exceedingly
readily—about as readily as the strongest acids and bases. There
are minor differences, but none of great moment—none of the kind
indicated by the wide range of constants for the acids and bases.
There are only a few important exceptions to this general rule—the
most important ones, among the common salts, being mercuric
chloride and mercuric cyanide: their exceptional behavior in
regard to ionization, as indicated by their conductivities (see
below), is found side by side with an exceptional chemical behavior,
exactly as the theory of ionization would lead us to anticipate,
and it renders necessary certain precautions, particularly in
analytical work, which will be discussed later (Chap. VI). Ordinary
salts are all ionized readily: for instance, whereas acetic acid in
molar solution is ionized only to the extent of 0.37 per cent,
its salts are highly ionized, the degree of ionization of sodium
acetate, for example, being 52.8% in molar solution. As in the
case of the strong acids and bases, salts of the type MeX, which
ionize according to the equation MeX ⇄ Me<sup>+</sup> + X<sup>−</sup> and which,
according to the law of chemical equilibrium, might be <em class="italic">expected</em>
to give a constant ratio [Me<sup>+</sup>][X<sup>−</sup>] / [MeX], do <em class="italic">not</em> give a <em class="italic">constant
ratio</em>. That is, when the values obtained for the concentrations of
the ions and of the nondissociated molecules, in solutions of various
<a id="p108" class="xxpn">[p108]</a> strengths, are substituted in this formula, different values are obtained.<a id="FNanchor_197_220" href="#Footnote_197_220" class="fnanchor">197</a>
For potassium chloride, we have the following relations:</div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Ionization of Strong Electrolytes and the Law of Chemical
Equilibrium.</h4>—The fact that the ionization of good electrolytes
does not seem to conform to the law of chemical equilibrium is an
exceedingly important one—it is, perhaps, the most important
problem demanding rigorous investigation, which is before chemists
at the present time. It has been used as an argument against the
whole theory of ionization, and is the most important objection
that has been urged against it. But, to the impartial observer,
this single discrepancy, between observation and what we might
have anticipated, will only prove a stronger stimulus to keener
investigation and to more rigorous analysis of relations, since the
latter are more complex than was at first expected. Without
considering the mass of evidence in favor of the theory, found in
other fields of chemistry and in physics, a part of which has been
given above, we must remember that this fundamental law of
chemical equilibrium has already decided unequivocally in favor
of the theory in hundreds of cases of the ionization of weak acids
and weak bases<a id="FNanchor_198_221" href="#Footnote_198_221" class="fnanchor">198</a> and that these are the cases where the conditions
are most simple.<a id="FNanchor_199_222" href="#Footnote_199_222" class="fnanchor">199</a> <a id="p109" class="xxpn">[p109]</a></div>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p>It would lead too far from our subject to enter into a full discussion of this
important question. It will be sufficient here to indicate two directions of
inquiry, which promise to lead to an explanation of the apparent contradiction
between the demands of the law of chemical equilibrium and the ionization
of strong electrolytes.</p>

<p>In the first place, the law of chemical equilibrium is based thermodynamically,
<em class="italic">i.e.</em> from the point of view of the ultimate energy relations involved,
on the assumption that none but negligible forces of attraction or repulsion
exist between the molecules, whose concentrations are factors in the equilibrium
equations (<em class="italic">cf.</em> p. <a href="#p095">95</a>).<a id="FNanchor_200_223" href="#Footnote_200_223" class="fnanchor">200</a> Now, in solutions of electrolytes this condition
is not strictly fulfilled under any circumstances; the attractions between ions
of opposite charge and the repulsions of ions of like charge, as well as the
effect of charged particles on neutral molecules, come into play. For strong
electrolytes, where the proportion of charged particles is always a large one,
the deviations from the simpler conditions to which alone the law is really
applicable must be very much greater than for weak electrolytes. It is, therefore,
probable that these electrical forces<a id="FNanchor_201_224" href="#Footnote_201_224" class="fnanchor">201</a> are the source of the deviation of
the ionization of strong electrolytes from the law of chemical equilibrium:
although ionization is a reversible reaction, forces come into play which make
the <em class="italic">simple law inapplicable</em>, and it is altogether likely, therefore, that we shall
find, when all the factors have been investigated, that strong electrolytes
should not and cannot obey <em class="italic">this law alone</em>.<a id="FNanchor_202_225" href="#Footnote_202_225" class="fnanchor">202</a> In confirmation of this conclusion,
recent careful calculations<a id="FNanchor_203_226" href="#Footnote_203_226" class="fnanchor">203</a> have shown that entirely analogous deviations
from the equilibrium law become perceptible in rather <em class="italic">concentrated</em> solutions
of weak electrolytes, such as acetic acid, in which there is an accumulation
of charged particles, more nearly akin to that present in <em class="italic">dilute</em> solutions of
strong electrolytes. So it appears more and more certain that the deviations
are a result of the presence of electrically charged components in the solutions,
the amount of deviation depending on their concentration.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The "Salt Effect".</h4>—In the second place,<a id="FNanchor_204_227" href="#Footnote_204_227" class="fnanchor">204</a> it seems possible
that the presence of strong electrolytes in a solution may modify the
<em class="italic">ionizing power of the solvent</em> in such a way as to increase it, and
to increase it the more, the more concentrated the ions are in the
solution.<a id="FNanchor_205_228" href="#Footnote_205_228" class="fnanchor">205</a> The ionizing power of solvents, as has been explained,
is intimately connected with their dielectric properties. <a id="p110" class="xxpn">[p110]</a></div>

<p>Now, solid <em class="italic">salts</em> have higher dielectric constants than has<a id="FNanchor_206_229" href="#Footnote_206_229" class="fnanchor">206</a> solid water, and
the dielectric constant of a compound is usually much higher in the liquid
than in the solid form.<a id="FNanchor_207_230" href="#Footnote_207_230" class="fnanchor">207</a> It is possible, therefore, that the presence of salts
in the solution increases the dielectric or, at any rate, the ionizing power of the
solvent and there are many facts which would be explained by such a behavior.
Unfortunately for any decision of the question, determinations of the dielectric
constants of salt solutions have given contradictory results; the more
recent, and possibly more reliable results of Drude<a id="FNanchor_208_231" href="#Footnote_208_231" class="fnanchor">208</a> indicate that salt solutions
show approximately the same dielectric behavior as water itself. Smale,
in Nernst's laboratory, on the other hand, obtained results indicating that
salt solutions have decidedly higher dielectric constants than pure water.<a id="FNanchor_209_232" href="#Footnote_209_232" class="fnanchor">209</a>
A final decision in the matter would be of great importance.<a id="FNanchor_210_233" href="#Footnote_210_233" class="fnanchor">210</a> But, as explained
before (p. <a href="#p064">64</a>), there are other properties of a solvent which seem
to be intimately related to its ionizing power and which may be modified by
the presence of salts, <em class="italic">i.e.</em> of strong electrolytes. The value obtained for the
proportion [Me<sup>+</sup>] × [X<sup>−</sup>] / [MeX] grows rapidly with increasing concentration,
<em class="italic">indicating a disproportionately large ionization in the more concentrated solutions</em>—which
is what one would expect, if <em class="italic">electrolytes or their ions in some way
increased</em> the ionizing power of the medium. In agreement with such a conclusion,
Arrhenius found<a id="FNanchor_211_234" href="#Footnote_211_234" class="fnanchor">211</a> that <em class="italic">the ionization of weak acids</em>, like acetic acid, is
increased by the presence of <em class="italic">foreign neutral</em> salts, such as sodium chloride.
This means, of course, that the strength of acetic acid, as an acid, is increased
likewise.</p>

<p><em class="smcap">Exp.</em> 0.5 c.c. of 0.1 molar acetic acid is added to 100 c.c. of a dilute
solution of methyl orange in each of three test glasses. When some solid
sodium chloride (3 grams, and then 3 grams more—altogether 0.1 mole)
is added to the one solution, a plain increase in the intensity of the acid tint
is observed.<a id="FNanchor_212_235" href="#Footnote_212_235" class="fnanchor">212</a> The addition of cane sugar to a second solution has no such
effect. The addition of sodium chloride to a fourth portion of the methyl
orange, to which no acetic acid has been added, shows that its color remains
unchanged: the effect on the indicator in the first case, then, is the result of
the action of the salt on the acetic acid.<a id="FNanchor_213_236" href="#Footnote_213_236" class="fnanchor">213</a> <a id="p111" class="xxpn">[p111]</a></p>

<p>The so-called "salt-effect" on the ionization of ammonium hydroxide may
be illustrated in a similar way.</p>

<p><em class="smcap">Exp.</em> 0.5 cc of 0.1 molar ammonium hydroxide is added to each of two
portions (100 c.c.) of a dilute solution of phenolphthaleïn. When some sodium
chloride solution is then added to one of the two portions, the basicity of
the solution is distinctly increased. The addition of sodium chloride to a
third portion of the phenolphthaleïn solution shows that its own reaction
to the indicator is neutral.</p>

<p>If the ionizing power of a solvent is changed by the presence of an electrolyte,
then the law of chemical equilibrium, in its simple form, would not
apply to the ionization of such electrolytes in varying concentrations—as
little as we should expect to obtain the same constant for acetic acid in aqueous
solution and in alcoholic solution, the ionizing power of alcohol being much
smaller than that of water. The deviation from the law, naturally, would
be most marked in the case of those electrolytes which ionize so easily as
readily to produce high concentrations of ions.</p></div>

<p>It may be said that <em class="italic">laws based on the electrical properties of salt
solutions</em> seem to be the predominating laws governing the ionization
of electrolytes and modifying, in certain cases, the chemical
laws based on the study of non-electrolytes.<a id="FNanchor_214_237" href="#Footnote_214_237" class="fnanchor">214</a></p>

<p>For the purposes of qualitative analysis, it will suffice to bear
in mind the fact that the ionization<a id="FNanchor_215_238" href="#Footnote_215_238" class="fnanchor">215</a> of salts, strong acids and
strong bases does not conform to the laws of mass action, and the
fact that practically all salts (with the notable exceptions, among
common salts, given on p. <a href="#p107">107</a>) <em class="italic">are very readily ionized</em> in aqueous
solution, namely to the extent of 40 to 85% in solutions of such
moderate concentration as 0.1 molar.<a id="FNanchor_216_239" href="#Footnote_216_239" class="fnanchor">216</a></p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Some Applications of the Law of Chemical Equilibrium.</h4>—According
to the discussions given above, for the ionization of
acetic acid, CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H ⇄ CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> + H<sup>+</sup> we have the relation</div>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
[CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>] × [H<sup>+</sup>] / [CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H] = K<sub>ionization</sub>.
</div></div>

<div class="xxpn"><a id="p112" class="xxpn">[p112]</a></div>

<p class="continue">If the concentrations of the components are modified in any
way, the condition of equilibrium is disturbed and change will
result, always toward the restoration of equilibrium. The changes,
in the case of purely ionic actions, are found to take place with an
enormous velocity, equilibrium being restored almost instantly.</p>

<p>(1) If the solution of acetic acid, represented in the above
equation, is diluted by an equal volume of water, the condition
of equilibrium is disturbed:</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
½ [CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>] × ½ [H<sup>+</sup>] / (½ [CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H]) &lt; K<sub>ionization.</sub>
</div></div>

<p class="continue">The ratio is smaller than that required for equilibrium, and there
will be a change towards increasing the ratio. The acid will
ionize more rapidly than it will be formed from the acetate and
hydrogen ions (which collide less frequently in the diluted solution)
and a new condition of equilibrium will be reached, when
more of the acid is ionized. We found, as a matter of fact, that
the more a solution of acetic acid is diluted, the larger is the proportion
of ionized acid (see p. <a href="#p099">99</a>).</p>

<p>(2) If the concentration of the acetate-ion is increased in the
solution by the addition of a salt of acetic acid, say sodium acetate,
we have</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
<em class="italic">x</em> [CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>] × [H<sup>+</sup>] / [CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H] &gt; K<sub>ionization.</sub>
</div></div>

<p class="continue">The ratio is larger than allowed by the equilibrium law, and the
acetate ions will combine with the hydrogen ions to form acetic
acid more rapidly than the ions are formed from it, until equilibrium
is reëstablished. In a molar solution of acetic acid, 0.42%
of the acid is ionized, and we have</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
<span class="ibnowrap">
[CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>] × [H<sup>+</sup>] / [CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H] =
<br />0.0042 × 0.0042 / 0.9958 = 1.8E−5.
</span></div></div>

<p class="continue">If an equivalent quantity of sodium acetate should be added, <em class="italic">i.e.</em>
one mole or 82 grams of the salt per liter, the salt being ionized
to the extent of 53%, we would have</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
0.534 × 0.0042 / 0.9958 &gt; 1.8E−5.
</div></div>

<p class="continue">The equilibrium constant will be satisfied (and the velocity of
ionization of the acetic acid will become equal to the velocity of its
<a id="p113" class="xxpn">[p113]</a> formation from its ions) when<a id="FNanchor_217_240" href="#Footnote_217_240" class="fnanchor">217</a> [CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>] = 0.53, [H<sup>+</sup>] = 0.000,034
and [CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H] = 0.999,966. If we use two characteristic places
in the decimals, we have</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
(0.53 × 0.000034) / 1 = 1.8E−5.
</div></div>

<p class="continue">The most significant fact in the new condition of equilibrium is
the <em class="italic">extremely small concentration of hydrogen-ion</em> in the solution.
Since the acid properties of acetic acid are due to its forming
hydrogen-ion, we would conclude that such properties of acetic
acid are <em class="italic">very much weakened</em> by the presence of its own salts.
This conclusion has been fully verified by careful quantitative
measurements and can be demonstrated as follows<a id="FNanchor_218_241" href="#Footnote_218_241" class="fnanchor">218</a>:</p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p><em class="smcap">Exp.</em> To two of three portions of a dilute solution of methyl orange
equal quantities of acetic acid are added (<em class="italic">e.g.</em> 0.5 c.c. molar acid), the third
portion being reserved to show the color of the neutral solution of the indicator.
Now, if into one of the solutions, to which acetic acid has been added,
a few crystals of sodium acetate are gradually dropped, the color reverts
gradually to the color of the original neutral solution; the concentration of
hydrogen-ion becomes so small, that it does not visibly affect this indicator,
which is not very sensitive to acids, (H<sup>+</sup>).<a id="FNanchor_219_242" href="#Footnote_219_242" class="fnanchor">219</a></p></div>

<p>The solution, according to the views expressed, <em class="italic">should still be very
slightly acid</em>, and by the use of an indicator (litmus paper) which
is much more sensitive to the hydrogen-ion than is methyl orange,
no difficulty is found in recognizing this fact also. As a matter
of experiment, then, an acid like acetic acid <em class="italic">is very much weaker in
the presence of its own salts than in their absence</em>, and the equilibrium
constant and the concentrations of the components used determine
the extent to which the hydrogen-ion is suppressed. The
same must be true for all weak acids and similar relations must
<a id="p114" class="xxpn">[p114]</a> hold for all weak bases<a id="FNanchor_220_243" href="#Footnote_220_243" class="fnanchor">220</a>—in general, <em class="italic">weak acids and weak bases
are very much weakened by the addition of their own salts</em>.</p>

<p>The importance of recognizing such changes, in considering
analytical reactions, may be illustrated as follows:</p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p><em class="smcap">Exp.</em> A solution of ferrous acetate (ferrous chloride with an equivalent
quantity of sodium acetate) is treated with hydrogen sulphide; a precipitate
of black ferrous sulphide is formed. A second portion of the solution is first
decidedly acidified with acetic acid: hydrogen sulphide does not precipitate
any ferrous sulphide. Some crystals of sodium or ammonium acetate are
added to the mixture and a black precipitate of iron sulphide immediately
appears around the salt as it dissolves, and on mixing the contents a heavy
precipitate of the sulphide throughout the vessel is formed.</p></div>

<p>It is evident that the addition of a neutral salt, containing the
same negative ion as the added acid, may completely reverse the
net result of a test with hydrogen sulphide.</p>

<p>(3) If the concentration of the hydrogen ions in the solution of
acetic acid is increased by the addition of hydrochloric, or some
other strong acid, equilibrium between the acetic acid and its
ions will likewise be disturbed and the new condition of equilibrium
will show a suppression of the acetate-ion. Instances of such
<em class="italic">action of a strong acid in suppressing the characteristic ions of weaker
acids</em> will be discussed in detail in connection with the analytical
applications of hydrogen sulphide (Chap. XI), where the action
is of peculiar importance. Strong bases have a similar effect on
weak bases.</p>

<p>(4) If one of the ions of acetic acid is <em class="italic">suppressed</em> by the addition
of some agent, equilibrium is again destroyed and the resulting
change is always in the direction of reëstablishing a condition of
equilibrium on the basis of the law of equilibrium. Instances of
this common case, such as the <em class="italic">neutralization</em> of acetic or any other
acid by a base, or the <em class="italic">driving out</em> of a <em class="italic">weak</em> acid, from its salts,
by a strong acid, or of a <em class="italic">weak</em> base by a <em class="italic">strong</em> base, considered
from the point of view of the equilibrium law, should be worked
out by the student.<a id="FNanchor_221_244" href="#Footnote_221_244" class="fnanchor">221</a> <a id="p115" class="xxpn">[p115]</a></p>

<p>(5) The displacement of an acid (or base) in salts by another
acid (or base) is subject always to the law that equilibrium is
reached, when all the equilibrium constants are satisfied in the
system. Very frequently, the application of the law will lead,
apparently, to the incorrect conclusion that the stronger acid (or
base) will <em class="italic">always</em> displace, more or less completely, the weaker<a id="FNanchor_222_245" href="#Footnote_222_245" class="fnanchor">222</a>—an
inference, out of which grew, indeed, the characterization of
acids and bases as strong and weak. Yet, when the laws of
equilibrium, as the result of the peculiar values of constants, demand
that, on the contrary, a strong acid or base should be displaced
by a weak, or even a feeble one, we find that the change
in this direction occurs with equal ease. Numerous instances
will be given where a weak acid (or a weak base) does this to a
certain extent (Chap. X), and others where precipitation of salts
facilitates the action of weaker acids greatly by the introduction
of new, physical constants. The following case of the liberation
of hydrochloric acid by the exceedingly weak acid, hydrocyanic
acid, is important because it shows a reversal of the common
action without the formation of any precipitate, and especially
because it brings out most strikingly the relations between ionization
and chemical activity in a case of special importance to
analytical chemists.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Exceptional Ionization of Mercuric Cyanide and Its Consequences.</h4>—We
have found that practically all salts are very
readily ionized. But it was mentioned that there are a few exceptions
to this rule, and mercuric chloride and especially mercuric
cyanide were named as the most important exceptions from
the point of view of analytical chemistry. The difference in
ionization between these two salts and ordinary salts may be
shown readily by the apparatus previously used to demonstrate
the difference in the ionization of various bases and acids.</div>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p><em class="smcap">Exp.</em> Into the parallel tubes of the conductivity apparatus (p. <a href="#p077">77</a>) equivalent
quantities<a id="FNanchor_223_246" href="#Footnote_223_246" class="fnanchor">223</a> of solutions of mercuric cyanide<a id="FNanchor_224_247" href="#Footnote_224_247" class="fnanchor">224</a> Hg(CN)<sub>2</sub>, mercuric chloride
<a id="p116" class="xxpn">[p116]</a> HgCl<sub>2</sub>, and barium chloride BaCl<sub>2</sub>, are introduced. The barium chloride
represents an ordinary salt of the same type as the mercury salts, and the
current passing through its solution makes the little lamp glow. The
electrodes in the mercuric chloride solution must be brought <em class="italic">quite close</em> together
before sufficient current will pass through the solution to bring its little
lamp to redness. In the case of the cyanide we can, at most, get a faint, dull
glow by bringing the electrodes together as closely as we can, without allowing
them to touch each other and short-circuit the current.</p></div>

<p>It is evident that these mercury salts are not as readily ionizable
as are ordinary salts. This difference, as may be anticipated,
shows itself also in the <em class="italic">chemical behavior</em> of their solutions
and makes <em class="italic">necessary special precautions on the part of the analyst
in examining mercury compounds</em>. For instance, whereas mercuric
oxide is readily precipitated by the addition of sodium
hydroxide to solutions of the nitrate and even of the moderately
ionized chloride, one fails to get a precipitate of oxide from the
cyanide solution (<em class="italic">exp.</em>), and if we relied on this test, we should
overlook the mercury entirely. That traces of the mercuric-ion
are present, as indicated by the minimal conductivity of the
cyanide, is confirmed by the fact that from the cyanide solution
the sulphide, which is much less soluble than is the oxide, may
be precipitated by the addition of ammonium sulphide (<em class="italic">exp.</em>).
That the sulphide is in fact less soluble<a id="FNanchor_225_248" href="#Footnote_225_248" class="fnanchor">225</a> than the oxide is shown
by the conversion of the latter into the former by the action of
ammonium sulphide (<em class="italic">exp.</em>).</p>

<p>As a further result of the abnormally slight ionization of these
mercury salts, the analyst, unless he is on his guard, may also
have difficulty in discovering the presence of their negative ions.
Thus, while sodium chloride readily gives hydrogen chloride
when treated with concentrated sulphuric acid, mercuric chloride,
although it is a soluble salt, does not (<em class="italic">exp.</em>), and reliance on
this test alone might lead to a gross error.<a id="FNanchor_226_249" href="#Footnote_226_249" class="fnanchor">226</a> In the case of the
cyanide, it is correspondingly difficult to recognize the <a id="p117" class="xxpn">[p117]</a>
cyanide-ion
(see the laboratory experiment, Part III). The ordinary
tests fail to show its presence until the mercury has been removed
from the solution by precipitation as a sulphide. Mercuric
cyanide being a deadly poison which analysts are liable to
meet and have met with in criminal cases, it is clear that a knowledge
of these facts is vital to analytical accuracy.</p>

<p>Now, the very slight ionization of mercuric cyanide enables us
to realize, in the following experiment, the case where an exceedingly
weak acid without the formation of any precipitate involving
physical constants, may displace a much stronger acid from
its salts. Hydrocyanic acid is one of the weakest acids (table,
p. <a href="#p104">104</a>), the constant for the ratio
[H<sup>+</sup>] × [CN<sup>−</sup>] / [HNC] being 0.7E−9.
It is so weak an acid that the addition of a dilute solution to
methyl orange will not redden the indicator, but will have only a
barely perceptible effect on it (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). Mercuric chloride solutions
also are almost neutral to methyl orange (<em class="italic">exp.</em>) (very slight
decomposition of the salt by water makes the solution very
slightly acid, not enough to produce more than an orange color
with methyl orange). Now, mercuric chloride, while it is not
very easily ionized, is, we found, very much more readily ionized
than is mercuric cyanide. The consequence is that when we add
hydrocyanic acid to a mercuric chloride solution, the equilibrium
between mercuric chloride and its ions and between hydrocyanic
acid and its ions will be decidedly displaced, <em class="italic">the mercuric-ion
combining with the cyanide-ion to form the scarcely ionizable mercuric
cyanide</em>. As a result, more and more of the molecular mercuric
chloride and hydrocyanic acid will be ionized; and since the
other ions, the chloride and the hydrogen ions, form a readily
ionizable electrolyte, hydrochloric acid, <em class="italic">these ions</em> (H<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>−</sup>)
<em class="italic">will accumulate in the solution</em> and we shall have sufficient <em class="italic">ionized

Since in any chemical action, which has not reached a condition of equilibrium,
the concentrations of the reacting substances change continuously,
the relation between the velocity of the action and the concentrations, for any
moment, is found by the application of the calculus to the experimental data.

The calculation of the condition of equilibrium can be made, with sufficient
accuracy for our purpose, as follows: The denominator 0.9958 in the original
proportion, being near its limit (its highest possible value is 1 in a molar
solution), cannot change appreciably. Consequently, when the one factor
in the numerator, [CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>], is made 0.53 / 0.0042, or 126 times as large as it
was, the other factor, [H<sup>+</sup>], to maintain a constant proportion, must be made
1 / 126th of its original value and 0.0042 / 126 = 0.000,034. For more exact
work, the new concentrations of the three components may be found by
solving a simple quadratic equation.</p></div>

<p>The law governing <em class="italic">physical</em> or <em class="italic">heterogeneous equilibrium</em> applies
to all cases where, at a constant temperature, one and the same
chemical substance is present in two or more physical conditions,
or "phases," in contact and in equilibrium with each other. We
have, for instance, the common case of a liquid, say water, in
contact with its vapor, or the liquid in contact with its solid
phase (ice) and its vapor; or, we may have a gas, say oxygen,
in contact with its solution in some solvent like water. We may
have a solid, like cane sugar, in contact with its solution. We
may also have a substance like bromine, which is soluble both in
chloroform and in water, present in both solutions at the same
time, the two solutions being in contact but immiscible. These
cases represent the most common types of systems to which the
law of physical equilibrium may be applied, although the list
has by no means been exhausted. <em class="italic">The law of physical or heterogeneous
equilibrium states that when one and the same chemical
compound is present in two physical states or phases</em>, as expressed

<p>It should be noted that the condition of equilibrium is independent
of the total quantity<a id="FNanchor_227_250" href="#Footnote_227_250" class="fnanchor">227</a> of substance present in either
phase or in both phases; that is, provided the <em class="italic">ratio</em> of the <em class="italic">concentrations</em>
is maintained constant at a given temperature, the <em class="italic">quantity
of substance present in both phases or in either phase is variable</em>.
For instance, the condition of equilibrium between water and
<a id="p119" class="xxpn">[p119]</a> water vapor is independent of the quantity of water or of water
vapor present: in a closed liter bottle containing water and water
vapor, the ratio of the concentrations is maintained, irrespective
of the question whether the bottle contains 10 c.c. of water and
990 c.c. of vapor or 990 c.c. of water and 10 c.c. of vapor.</p>

<p>The law is one of experience; instances of its application are
given below. Its probable theoretical significance may be explained
mechanically with the aid of the kinetic theory of gases
and solutions, as follows: If chloroform is added to a solution of
bromine in water, the chloroform takes up part of the bromine
and, if the mixture is vigorously shaken, a condition of equilibrium
and a definite distribution of bromine between the two
solvents will result (<em class="italic">exp.</em><a id="FNanchor_228_251" href="#Footnote_228_251" class="fnanchor">228</a>). Now, if one imagines a liter of the
aqueous solution to contain <em class="italic">one mole</em> of bromine at some given
temperature and to cover a liter of chloroform, the whole system
being left to itself, then all the conditions affecting the migration
of the bromine into the chloroform will be definite ones—the
concentration of the bromine, the temperature, the surface between
the two solvents—and bromine will pass from the
aqueous solution into the chloroform solution at a definite speed.
We may call the <em class="italic">quantity</em> (in moles) of bromine which would
enter the chloroform in one minute, if the concentration of the
bromine in the water were kept constant (one mole) throughout
the minute, the <em class="italic">velocity of migration</em> of the bromine—this velocity,
like chemical velocity, representing a quantity, not a distance.
The velocity being a definite one under these conditions, we have
<em class="italic">v</em><sub>1</sub> = <em class="italic">k</em><sub>1</sub>. Now, if all the conditions are left unaltered, except
that the concentration of the bromine is changed, say kept at
one-hundredth its original value, then only one one-hundredth as
many molecules of bromine as in the first case will come into
contact with the chloroform surface in unit time. The chances for
migration are one one-hundredth as great, and the quantity
entering the chloroform in unit time—the velocity of the <a id="p120" class="xxpn">[p120]</a>
change—will
be one one-hundredth of the original velocity. In general,
<em class="italic">the velocity will be proportional to the concentration of the bromine</em>
[Br]<sub>aq.</sub> <em class="italic">in the water at any moment</em> and to the characteristic constant
<em class="italic">k</em><sub>1</sub>.</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
<em class="italic">v</em><sub>1</sub> = [Br]<sub>aq.</sub> × <em class="italic">k</em><sub>1</sub>.
</div></div>

<p>On the other hand, if a solution of bromine in chloroform is
covered with water, bromine enters the water (<em class="italic">exp.</em>).<a id="FNanchor_229_252" href="#Footnote_229_252" class="fnanchor">229</a> We would
find, by the method of analysis used before, and for the same conditions,
that the velocity of migration, <em class="italic">v</em><sub>2</sub>, of the bromine into the
water is also proportional to a characteristic constant, <em class="italic">k</em><sub>2</sub>, and to
the concentration of the bromine in the chloroform [Br]<sub>ch.</sub>. We

<div class="h4p"><h4>Applications of the Law of Physical Equilibrium.</h4>—(1) The law
of physical equilibrium may be applied first to the case of a liquid,
say chloroform, in contact with its vapor. For the condition of
equilibrium at a fixed temperature [CHCl<sub>3</sub>]<sub>vap.</sub> : [CHCl<sub>3</sub>]<sub>liq.</sub> = <em class="italic">k</em>.</div>

<p>Now, at a fixed temperature, a pure liquid has a fixed concentration,
its specific gravity being a definite one. Hence, for a fixed
temperature, the second term of the constant ratio being definite,
the first term, [CHCl<sub>3</sub>]<sub>vap.</sub>, representing the concentration of the
vapor, must also have a fixed, constant value for the condition of
equilibrium, <em class="italic">i.e.</em> when the space above the liquid is saturated with
its vapor. This is in agreement with well-known facts. The
concentration of the vapor is usually expressed in terms of its
<a id="p121" class="xxpn">[p121]</a> pressure, and is called the <em class="italic">vapor pressure</em> or <em class="italic">vapor tension</em> of the
liquid at the temperature in question. Tables giving the definite
vapor pressures of important liquids at the various fixed temperatures
are in common use.</p>

<p>(2) For oxygen in equilibrium with its saturated solution, say
in water, at a fixed temperature, we have, according to the law,
[O<sub>2</sub>]<sub>gas</sub> : [O<sub>2</sub>]<sub>solut.</sub> = <em class="italic">k</em>.</p>

<p>If the oxygen is under a given pressure at a definite temperature,
its concentration [O<sub>2</sub>]<sub>gas</sub> is fixed, and consequently the second
term, [O<sub>2</sub>]<sub>solut.</sub>, of the ratio, the concentration of the dissolved
oxygen, or <em class="italic">its solubility, must also be definite</em>, <em class="italic">i.e.</em> oxygen must
have a definite solubility in water at a given temperature under a
given pressure. If the pressure on the gas is doubled, its concentration
is doubled and, to maintain the constant ratio, its solubility
must also be doubled—which is in agreement with the
facts (Henry's law). If air of the same pressure is taken, in
place of pure oxygen, then the concentration of the oxygen (first
term of the above ratio) is only about one-fifth as great as for the
pure gas, and the water must be saturated with oxygen when it
has taken up only one-fifth (second term of the ratio) as much as
it would from the pure gas (Dalton's law): <em class="italic">Each gas in a mixture
is soluble in proportion to its own partial pressure</em> or <em class="italic">concentration</em>.</p>

<p>(3) For sugar in equilibrium with its solution in water, <em class="italic">i.e.</em> in
contact with its saturated solution, at a given temperature, we
should have</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
[C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>]<sub>aq.</sub> : [C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>]<sub>solid</sub> = <em class="italic">k</em>.
</div></div>

<p class="continue">Since a pure solid like sugar at a given temperature has a definite
specific gravity, the concentration of the sugar in the solid condition
should also be a definite one. Consequently, according to
the law under discussion, the first term,
[C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>]<sub>aq.</sub>, of the ratio,
the concentration of the sugar in its saturated solution in contact
with the solid phase, must also have a definite value. This is in
agreement with fact, the concentration of the sugar in the saturated
solution, termed its solubility, being a definite one for a
given temperature. (See below, p. <a href="#p123">123</a>, in regard to the solubility
of fine powders.)</p>


<div class="h4p"><h4>Supersaturated Solutions.</h4>— It is well known, however, that
by dissolving a substance, such as sugar, in hot water and carefully
<a id="p122" class="xxpn">[p122]</a> cooling the solution, we may obtain a solution of sugar containing
much more sugar in unit volume than is represented by
its solubility at the lower temperature. The concentration of
the sugar at the temperature in question, instead of having the
definite value represented by [C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>]<sub>aq.</sub>, can easily have a
value several times as large. This phenomenon <em class="italic">is not at variance
with the law of physical equilibrium</em>, inasmuch as the law states
that, when a given compound is present in <em class="italic">two</em> physical states or
phases, then a constant ratio between the concentrations of the
substance in the two phases is established when equilibrium is
reached at a given temperature. In the solution prepared as
described, we have the substance present only in one phase, and
we have what may be called a metastable condition, as long as the
second phase is not introduced. As soon as a minute crystal of
the solid phase is added or is formed in the solution, change
immediately ensues, and the excess of solid is deposited. If the
mixture be kept perfectly quiet, the excess will in most cases be
deposited on the <em class="italic">surfaces</em> of the added crystal, which thereby grows
larger (rock-candy manufacture).</div>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p><em class="smcap">Exp.</em> Supersaturated solutions of sodium sulphate and sodium thiosulphate,
into which crystals of the salts are dropped, show how the crystal starts
crystallization. The crystals develop as branches from the crystal first
introduced and from the new crystals formed.</p></div>

<p>This phenomenon of <em class="italic">supersaturation</em> is one which analytical
chemists must always take into consideration. Tests which involve
the precipitation of substances that are merely difficultly soluble,
rather than exceedingly insoluble, or of substances present only
in very small quantities, may well lead to entirely wrong conclusions,
if precautions are not taken against the possibility of the
failure of a precipitate to appear as a consequence of persistent
supersaturation. For instance, a common test for the presence
of potassium salts consists in the precipitation of <em class="italic">potassium acid
tartrate</em> by the addition of tartaric acid to the solution of a potassium
salt (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). The tartrate is somewhat soluble and tends to
form supersaturated solutions; if we proceed without due regard
for this phenomenon, we may readily have a quantity of potassium
salt present and fail to obtain the test for it. Simply mixing
tartaric acid and potassium chloride solutions (<em class="italic">exp.</em>) may fail to
<a id="p123" class="xxpn">[p123]</a> give any precipitate, and if the test is thrown away and potassium
reported absent, a glaring blunder is committed. To insure
against the error of supersaturation, we try to start crystallization
by the common devices of shaking the solution or "scratching"
the walls of the vessel, the object being to facilitate the formation
of the first crystal. The surest method is to <em class="italic">inoculate</em> a small
portion of the mixture with a <em class="italic">minute</em> crystal of the substance we
expect to be formed. If no precipitate results in a short time, the
solution is not supersaturated—it may be too dilute and may
require further concentration, but the error of supersaturation has
been excluded.</p>

<p>The relation between supersaturated solutions and crystals
brings out sharply the fact that physical equilibrium is essentially
a condition of equilibrium between the substance at the <em class="italic">surface</em>
of the solid and the substance in its dissolved state. In terms of
the molecular theory, equilibrium is established when the molecules
of the crystal surface dissolve as rapidly as molecules from the
solution are deposited on the surface. If the concentration of
the dissolved molecules is reduced below the point required for
equilibrium, the velocity of deposition is diminished. The velocity
of solution will then be greater than the velocity of deposition
and <em class="italic">solution</em> will result. The reversed relations hold when the
concentration of the solution is greater than that demanded by
equilibrium: the velocity of deposition will be the greater than
that of solution and <em class="italic">precipitation</em> follows.<a id="FNanchor_231_254" href="#Footnote_231_254" class="fnanchor">231</a></p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Solubility of Fine Powders.</h4>—Consideration of the surface
forces, acting between crystals and the liquids wetting them, led
to the interesting prediction<a id="FNanchor_232_255" href="#Footnote_232_255" class="fnanchor">232</a> that the more minute crystals of a
given specimen would not only dissolve more rapidly, on account
of the larger surface exposed, but would also be <em class="italic">more soluble</em>
than the larger crystals, and for the same reason. Surface tension
always tends to produce the smallest possible free surface of a
liquid, and the free surface between a liquid and a given weight of
solid material in a fine powder is much larger than between the
liquid and the same weight in larger crystals. The surface tension
<a id="p124" class="xxpn">[p124]</a> will therefore tend to convert the smaller crystals into larger
ones, and it can do so only by means of a greater degree of solubility
of the former. This prediction has now been fully verified
by experiments on the solubility of barium sulphate and of gypsum.<a id="FNanchor_233_256" href="#Footnote_233_256" class="fnanchor">233</a>
The solubility of barium sulphate in a very fine powder
(with an average diameter of 10<sup>−4</sup> mm.) is almost twice as great
as the solubility of a coarser material (18E−4 mm. average
diameter).</div>

<p>The application of these relations to analysis is as follows: If
a crystalline precipitate is in contact with a solvent, <em class="italic">e.g.</em> if barium
sulphate is in contact with the liquid from which it has been
precipitated, then this liquid must be continually in a state of
change, not of equilibrium, with respect to the solution and the
deposited barium sulphate. The more minute crystals, being a
little more soluble than the larger ones, will supersaturate the
solution in respect to the larger crystals and the excess will be
deposited on these larger crystals and make them grow still
larger. This deposition will make the solution unsaturated with
respect to the smaller crystals and more of these will dissolve.
The process is obviously a continuous one, and must lead in time
to the disappearance of the minute crystals and the growth of the
larger ones. That is a result which analysts aim to attain,—which
in quantitative work it is in fact necessary to attain, since the
more minute crystals are likely to pass through filters and be lost
in the analysis. The views expressed, and the experimental confirmation
of the conclusion reached, form the theory of what is
called the "digesting" of precipitates before they are brought
on filters. It is clear that every condition facilitating contact
between solvent and solid will accelerate the desired change and
continuous <em class="italic">stirring</em> is therefore desirable. Heating is, as a rule,
also to be desired for very insoluble precipitates, as it will, in the
majority of cases, facilitate the solution of the undesirable, finer
crystals.</p>

<p>In conclusion, these considerations will also indicate the precautions
to be observed in the precipitation of difficultly soluble
substances. If this is not properly carried out, endless trouble in
<a id="p125" class="xxpn">[p125]</a> the analytical laboratory results. Except when heating is, for some
special reason, undesirable—as inducing a chemical change (like
hydrolysis) that is not wanted—solutions are brought to the boiling-point,
and <em class="italic">the precipitant added drop by drop</em>, in order not to supersaturate
the solution too strongly. The solution is thus allowed
time to deposit its excess as far as possible on the <em class="italic">first crystals
formed</em>, which it will do rather than to form new, minute ones (see
supersaturation, p. <a href="#p121">121</a>). <em class="italic">Constant stirring</em> is prescribed in order to
bring older crystals, as far as possible, into contact with all parts of
the slightly supersaturated solution. After the precipitation is complete,
it is usually desirable to allow the mixture to "digest" for
some time, for the reasons given above—stirring and a high temperature
during the process being desirable. (See further Chap.
VIII, p. <a href="#p147">147</a>, <em class="italic">in regard to the use of an excess of precipitant</em>.)</p>

<h4 class="block">The Colloidal Condition</h4>

<p>When a difficultly soluble substance is formed in a solution
beyond the point of saturation of the solution, the substance in
question <em class="italic">separates</em> from the solution <em class="italic">in a new phase</em>, according to
the principles just laid down. Ordinarily, if the substance is a
solid, a <em class="italic">precipitate</em> is formed; if a gas, a gas escapes; if a liquid, a
liquid separates out, which is immiscible with the solution in which
it is formed. Occasionally, the condition of supersaturation which
precedes the separation is somewhat persistent, but this resistance
to the separation of the phase may be overcome by vigorous
agitation of the solution or, as in the case of supersaturation with
a crystallizable salt, by inoculation of the solution with a particle
of the new phase (p. <a href="#p123">123</a>).</p>

<p>Under certain conditions, however, a difficultly soluble substance
may be produced in a solution, in a concentration far beyond
its solubility, <em class="italic">without the separation of a precipitate</em> (evolution of
a gas or formation of a separate liquid) <em class="italic">and also without the
formation of a supersaturated solution</em>. Thus, when hydrogen sulphide
is passed into an aqueous solution of arsenious oxide, the
liquid acquires the yellow to orange color of <em class="italic">arsenious sulphide</em>
and becomes opalescent. But no <em class="italic">precipitate</em> is seen (<em class="italic">exp.</em>), in spite
of the fact that the sulphide is extremely insoluble and is formed
practically quantitatively according to the equation As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> +
3 H<sub>2</sub>S ⇄ As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> + 3 H<sub>2</sub>O. The orange liquid passes through a
<a id="p126" class="xxpn">[p126]</a> filter unchanged (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). But if some hydrochloric acid or a salt
(<em class="italic">e.g.</em> sodium chloride) solution is added to a portion of it, a heavy
precipitate of arsenious sulphide is immediately produced (<em class="italic">exp.</em>);
its quantity is a good indication of the great amount of sulphide
that is <em class="italic">not</em> precipitated before the addition of the acid or salt.
If some pure arsenic sulphide (solid) is added to another portion
of the orange liquid, in order to overcome any possible condition
of supersaturation, the liquid is found to remain clear (but opalescent),
excepting for the few particles of added sulphide (<em class="italic">exp.</em>);
even when it is vigorously shaken (<em class="italic">exp.</em>), or allowed to stand for
days, no precipitate is formed. We are therefore not dealing with
a case of supersaturation.</p>

<p>A liquid, in which a very insoluble substance appears thus to be
in solution far beyond its usual degree of solubility, and yet does
not show at all the behavior of a supersaturated solution, is said to
contain the substance in the <em class="bold">colloidal condition</em>. After a few
more instances of the colloidal condition have been presented, the
significance of the condition and the meaning of the term used
to designate it will be explained.</p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<div class="h4p"><h4>Colloidal Gold.</h4>—When a solution of gold chloride<a id="FNanchor_234_257" href="#Footnote_234_257" class="fnanchor">234</a> is treated with a solution
of stannous chloride which contains a little stannic chloride,<a id="FNanchor_235_258" href="#Footnote_235_258" class="fnanchor">235</a> a purple-red,
flocculent precipitate—the "purple of Cassius"—is formed; in extremely
dilute solutions only a purple-red liquid<a id="FNanchor_236_259" href="#Footnote_236_259" class="fnanchor">236</a> may be produced. If the
precipitate is collected on a filter, washed with water and then treated, on
the filter, with a few drops of ammonium hydroxide solution and some water
(<em class="italic">exp.</em>), it is seen to <em class="italic">dissolve</em> and a beautifully colored liquid, of purple-red or
claret-red tint, is found to pass through the filter. In spite of the extreme
insolubility of metallic gold, the red ammoniacal solution (as well as the first
red precipitate) contains <em class="bold">metallic gold</em>, in the colloidal condition, formed according
to the equation<a id="FNanchor_237_260" href="#Footnote_237_260" class="fnanchor">237</a> 2 Au<sup>3+</sup> + 3 Sn<sup>2+</sup> ⥂ 2 Au + 3 Sn<sup>4+</sup>. By the careful

slightly alkaline solution,<a id="FNanchor_239_262" href="#Footnote_239_262" class="fnanchor">239</a> brilliant red liquids, containing metallic gold in
the colloidal condition, may be prepared, which remain clear for months.
The passage of an electric current, in the form of an arc, between two gold
points under pure water produces similar red liquids<a id="FNanchor_240_263" href="#Footnote_240_263" class="fnanchor">240</a> containing metallic
gold.</div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Colloidal Silver.</h4>—Further, although silver is likewise an extremely insoluble
metal, solid preparations of silver are known which, on treatment
with water, form apparently perfectly clear (opalescent) liquids or solutions
(<em class="italic">exp.</em>).<a id="FNanchor_241_264" href="#Footnote_241_264" class="fnanchor">241</a> From these silver is not deposited, even in the course of months. If a
little of the black solid is heated on the lid of a porcelain crucible, the metal
may be readily recognized by its white color and luster.<a id="FNanchor_242_265" href="#Footnote_242_265" class="fnanchor">242</a></div></div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Colloidal Ferric Hydroxide.</h4>—Further, if to a solution of ferric
chloride an excess of ammonium hydroxide is added, the well-known,
rust-red precipitate of very difficultly soluble ferric hydroxide
is formed: FeCl<sub>3</sub> + 3 NH<sub>4</sub>OH ⥂ Fe(OH)<sub>3</sub> ↓ + 3 NH<sub>4</sub>Cl.
The precipitate is so insoluble that it is a favorable form for precipitating
the ferric-ion in quantitative analysis. If, however, a
solution of ferric chloride be carefully neutralized with ammonium
carbonate<a id="FNanchor_243_266" href="#Footnote_243_266" class="fnanchor">243</a> and be then placed in a vessel (called a dialyzer),
in such a way that it is separated, by an animal membrane or by
parchment, from pure water, ferric hydroxide is obtained in an
apparently soluble form. The ammonium chloride, as well as
hydrochloric acid which is formed by the decomposition of the
chloride by water (FeCl<sub>3</sub> + 3 HOH ⇄ Fe(OH)<sub>3</sub> + 3 HCl, see
Chapter X), are found to pass through the membrane readily,
while the ferric hydroxide produced does not pass through such
<a id="p128" class="xxpn">[p128]</a> membranes<a id="FNanchor_244_267" href="#Footnote_244_267" class="fnanchor">244</a> and is retained in the dialyzer <em class="italic">without forming a precipitate</em>.
The acid and salt pass through such membranes in
either direction, indeed, but flow mainly from their solutions of
higher concentration to those of lower concentration. The water
on the outside of the dialyzer is, therefore, continuously renewed,
in order to insure a concentration of these substances on the outside
of the dialyzer lower than that within it. As the hydrochloric
acid is thus removed through the membrane, the condition of
equilibrium between the ferric chloride, water, ferric hydroxide
and acid is continuously disturbed and, in the reversible reaction,
expressed in the above equation, the action is carried more and
more towards the right, and more and more ferric hydroxide is
formed. The salt is, at last, practically all decomposed and a <em class="italic">clear
red opalescent liquid, which contains ferric hydroxide in enormous
excess beyond its solubility in water</em>, is left in the dialyzer.</div>

<p>Exactly as in the case of the other liquids discussed above, in
which very insoluble substances appear to be in solution far beyond
their usual degree of solubility, so the present liquid does not show
the behavior of a supersaturated solution and it is <em class="italic">said to contain
the ferric hydroxide in the</em> <em class="bold">colloidal condition</em>.<a id="FNanchor_245_268" href="#Footnote_245_268" class="fnanchor">245</a></p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Solution Theory of the Colloidal Condition.</h4>—For many years
the belief was prevalent among chemists that these liquids represent
true solutions of difficultly soluble substances, in the form
of soluble (colloidal) <em class="italic">modifications</em> of the substances. Like ordinary
<a id="p129" class="xxpn">[p129]</a> solutions, the liquids are found, indeed, to show a certain <em class="italic">osmotic
pressure</em>, but, unlike ordinary solutions, the osmotic pressure is
exceedingly small in proportion to the quantity of the substance
present. Since the osmotic pressure is proportional to the number
of molecules in unit volume (Chap. II), this observation
proved the presence of a relatively very small number of molecules
in solution, and chemists were led to assign, therefore, a
relatively very great weight to each. Hence, the data led to
the assumption that the colloidal modifications consist of molecules
of very large, sometimes enormous molecular weight. From
the fact that colloids are unable to traverse membranes, through
which crystalloids readily pass, Graham had reached the same
conclusion.</div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Suspension Theory of the Colloidal Condition.</h4>—On the
other hand, a number of chemists considered the colloidal liquids
to represent, essentially, <em class="italic">suspensions of minute solid particles</em><a id="FNanchor_247_270" href="#Footnote_247_270" class="fnanchor">247</a> in
an extreme state of subdivision, or, in some instances, perfect
<a id="p130" class="xxpn">[p130]</a> emulsions of difficultly miscible liquids.<a id="FNanchor_248_271" href="#Footnote_248_271" class="fnanchor">248</a> Observations with the
ultramicroscope<a id="FNanchor_249_272" href="#Footnote_249_272" class="fnanchor">249</a> finally proved,<a id="FNanchor_250_273" href="#Footnote_250_273" class="fnanchor">250</a> beyond question, the correctness
of this theory of the colloidal condition. Thus, the colloidal "solutions"
of gold are seen to contain minute solid particles of gold,
the diameter of which varies<a id="FNanchor_251_274" href="#Footnote_251_274" class="fnanchor">251</a> between (approximately) 60 µµ and
6 µµ and the color of which varies with their size. Still finer subdivisions,
the diameter of whose particles cannot be measured, are
also found to exist. Colloidal silver, platinum, arsenious sulphide
and other colloidal metals and sulphides have also been shown, in
the same way, to be suspensions of solid particles.</div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The General Character and the Definition of the Colloidal
Condition.</h4>—Recent investigations have shown that the colloidal
condition is possible, not only for a limited class of substances, but
is, in general, possible for all substances.<a id="FNanchor_252_275" href="#Footnote_252_275" class="fnanchor">252</a> Thus, even such an
eminently crystallizable, readily soluble (in water) substance as
sodium chloride may be obtained, under certain conditions, in
colloidal suspension in benzene,<a id="FNanchor_253_276" href="#Footnote_253_276" class="fnanchor">253</a> in which it is insoluble.</div>

<p>For our purposes it will be sufficient to define the colloidal
condition, on the basis of these results, as the condition of an
insoluble substance in which, as far as ordinary observation and
the common methods for separation of heterogeneous phases (filtration,
sedimentation, etc.) are concerned, <em class="italic">the substance appears
to be present in a homogeneous clear solution</em>, whereas <em class="italic">in reality</em> it
is present in a <em class="italic">heterogeneous mixture</em>. An extremely finely divided
solid suspended in a liquid, or an emulsified liquid suspended in
another liquid, are the most common types<a id="FNanchor_254_277" href="#Footnote_254_277" class="fnanchor">254</a> of such mixtures. <a id="p131" class="xxpn">[p131]</a></p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Relations to Analysis.</h4>—Since the colloidal condition of insoluble
substances interferes with the precipitation of the latter,
and with their separation by filtration from the liquids in which
they are suspended, and since the majority of the separations
and tests of analytical chemistry depend on the successful formation
of precipitates and on their successful separation by filtration,
analytical chemistry is primarily<a id="FNanchor_255_278" href="#Footnote_255_278" class="fnanchor">255</a> concerned with the colloidal
condition as a condition that is to be <em class="italic">avoided as completely as
possible</em> in order to escape error. In other fields of chemistry,
notably in physiological chemistry and in some branches of
technical chemistry, it is a source of effects so momentous and
specific that a new branch of chemistry, the chemistry of colloids,<a id="FNanchor_256_279" href="#Footnote_256_279" class="fnanchor">256</a>
has grown out of the investigations of its relations and laws. The
present discussion will be limited to the presentation of such of
the fundamental facts concerning the colloidal condition as are
of chief importance in analytical work.<a id="FNanchor_257_280" href="#Footnote_257_280" class="fnanchor">257</a></div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Electrical Conditions of Colloids.</h4>—One of the most important
discoveries made on colloids is the observation that the suspended
particles of a large class of colloids carry electrical charges, so that
there is a potential difference between the particles and the liquid
in which the suspension exists.<a id="FNanchor_258_281" href="#Footnote_258_281" class="fnanchor">258</a> Thus, in the colloidal suspension
of arsenious sulphide (prepared as described on p. <a href="#p125">125</a>) the <em class="italic">sulphide
particles</em> carry <em class="italic">negative</em> charges, and the solution bathing them is
<em class="italic">positive</em>. Conversely, colloidal <em class="italic">ferric hydroxide</em> (p. <a href="#p127">127</a>), in water,
is charged with <em class="italic">positive</em>, the water with <em class="italic">negative</em>, electricity. The
existence and character of these charges may be readily demonstrated
by the passage of a current of electricity through the
colloidal suspension in U tubes (<em class="italic">exp.</em>).<a id="FNanchor_259_282" href="#Footnote_259_282" class="fnanchor">259</a> Colloidal arsenious sulphide
is found to migrate toward the positive pole, ferric hydroxide
<a id="p132" class="xxpn">[p132]</a> to the negative pole, the movement being easily followed by the
color of the suspended particles.</div>

<p>The following colloids, which are of interest in analytical
chemistry, are found to carry a <em class="italic">negative</em> charge in pure water:
Colloidal <em class="italic">acids</em> (silicic, stannic), <em class="italic">sulphides</em> (As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub>, CdS, etc.),
<em class="italic">salts</em> (AgI, AgCl) and <em class="italic">metals</em> (Au, Pt, Ag). It is noteworthy that
the suspensions of finely divided clay, kaolin, quartz, carbon,
carry the same charge as these colloidal suspensions. On the
other hand, <em class="italic">metal hydroxides</em> (ferric, aluminium, chromic), and <em class="italic">basic</em>
substances in general, carry <em class="italic">positive</em> charges.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the colloids of one important group are found
to be almost without any electric charges;<a id="FNanchor_260_283" href="#Footnote_260_283" class="fnanchor">260</a> the passage of an electric
current through their suspensions has little or no effect on
them. Perfectly neutral albumen and gelatine are common representatives
of this group.</p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p>The charge on a colloid seems to be liable to variation with the nature of
the liquid in which it is suspended. Colloidal platinum in water is negative,
in a mixture of water and alcohol, positive.[2] Of peculiar interest and importance
is the fact that some colloids <em class="italic">change</em> the <em class="italic">character</em> of their <em class="italic">charge</em> when the
liquid, in which they are suspended, is made to pass from an <em class="italic">acid</em> to an <em class="italic">alkaline</em>
condition, and <em class="italic">vice versa</em>.<a id="FNanchor_261_284" href="#Footnote_261_284" class="fnanchor">261</a> For instance, albumen<a id="FNanchor_262_285" href="#Footnote_262_285" class="fnanchor">262</a>, colloidal silicic acid<a id="FNanchor_263_286" href="#Footnote_263_286" class="fnanchor">263</a> and
colloidal stannic acid<a id="FNanchor_264_287" href="#Footnote_264_287" class="fnanchor">264</a> are negative in alkaline liquids, positive in acid. The
relation of these facts to the chemical nature of the substances will be discussed
presently.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Source of the Electrical Charges on Colloids.</h4>—Different views are
held as to the source of electrification of colloidal suspensions. Only the two
views of most direct interest in analysis can be considered here. In the first
place, it is possible that <em class="italic">partial ionization</em> of the colloidal suspension produces
the electrical charge. It is a significant fact that <em class="italic">basic colloids</em> (metal hydroxides,
some basic dyes) receive a <em class="italic">positive</em> charge, such as would be left, if they
were slightly ionized as bases (or salts of bases) and insoluble (suspended)
<a id="p133" class="xxpn">[p133]</a> <em class="italic">positive ions were retained by the particles</em>. That would be the case, for instance,
if particles of colloidal ferric hydroxide, [Fe(OH)<sub>3</sub>]<sub><em class="italic">x</em></sub>, sent a few hydroxide
ions into solution and the suspended particles included positive insoluble
ions. <em class="italic">Acid</em> colloids, on the other hand, assume a <em class="italic">negative</em> charge, as would be
expected from this point of view. Then, the behavior of silicic acid is particularly
suggestive; in alkaline or <em class="italic">slightly</em> acid liquids, in which its <em class="italic">ionization as
a weak acid</em> is favored or predominant (Chapter X), it carries a <em class="italic">negative</em> charge,
the charge that would be left on it, if it ionized, in part, as an acid or its salt.
Silicic acid shows some slight tendency to ionize also as a base (see Chapter X)
and the basic form of ionization would be favored by the presence of a strong
acid (Chapter X). Colloidal silicic acid, as stated above, <em class="italic">changes its charge</em>
from negative to positive as the solution passes from an alkaline to a (strong)
acid reaction,<a id="FNanchor_265_288" href="#Footnote_265_288" class="fnanchor">265</a> just as if, in the acid liquid, it ionized slightly as a base (salt of
a base) and <em class="italic">retained a difficultly soluble positive ion</em>. Albumen, which has the
property of being both a base and an acid,<a id="FNanchor_266_289" href="#Footnote_266_289" class="fnanchor">266</a> shows the same change of
charge<a id="FNanchor_267_290" href="#Footnote_267_290" class="fnanchor">267</a> in the colloidal condition and the change has been ascribed<a id="FNanchor_268_291" href="#Footnote_268_291" class="fnanchor">268</a> to the
change of basic and acid functions.</div>

<p>According to the other of the two theories, here considered, the electrification
of the colloid may result from what is known as contact or surface
electricity.<a id="FNanchor_269_292" href="#Footnote_269_292" class="fnanchor">269</a> At the surface of two different substances there is always a
potential difference.<a id="FNanchor_270_293" href="#Footnote_270_293" class="fnanchor">270</a> In the case of finely divided suspensions, like the colloids,
the contact surfaces are enormous, as compared with the surfaces involved in
ordinary contact. Whether metals (Au, Pt, Ag) owe their charges to simple
contact effects or to their (minimal) tendency to ionize (Chapters XIV and
XV) is not known. In fact, no exact knowledge of the source of electrification
of any colloid has yet been obtained.</p></div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Precipitation of Colloids by Electrolytes and by Colloids.</h4>—Substances
in the colloidal condition, <em class="italic">which carry an electrical
charge</em>, are readily precipitated by the addition of electrolytes to
the colloidal suspensions (see the behavior of arsenious sulphide,
p. <a href="#p126">126</a>). Negatively charged colloids are precipitated by the action
of positive ions, positively charged colloids by the action of
negative ions (Hardy's rule<a id="FNanchor_271_294" href="#Footnote_271_294" class="fnanchor">271</a>). The precipitated colloid carries
<a id="p134" class="xxpn">[p134]</a> with it a part of the precipitating ion<a id="FNanchor_272_295" href="#Footnote_272_295" class="fnanchor">272</a> (<em class="italic">adsorption</em>) and the weights
of ions, carried down by a given quantity of a given colloid, are
proportional to the equivalent weights of the ions.<a id="FNanchor_273_296" href="#Footnote_273_296" class="fnanchor">273</a> The precipitation
thus appears to be intimately associated with the neutralization
of the charge on the colloid. In accordance with this conclusion,
it has also been found that a colloid may be precipitated
by a colloid carrying the opposite charge.<a id="FNanchor_274_297" href="#Footnote_274_297" class="fnanchor">274</a> Thus, colloidal arsenious
sulphide, carrying a negative charge, and colloidal ferric
hydroxide, carrying a positive charge, mutually precipitate each
other (<em class="italic">exp.</em><a id="FNanchor_275_298" href="#Footnote_275_298" class="fnanchor">275</a>).</div>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p>The purple precipitate (<em class="italic">purple of Cassius</em>), which is formed when
stannous chloride is added to gold chloride (p. <a href="#p126">126</a>), contains
<em class="italic">colloidal
gold</em>,<a id="FNanchor_276_299" href="#Footnote_276_299" class="fnanchor">276</a>
which, in suspension, is charged with
negative electricity, and <em class="italic">colloidal stannic
acid</em>,<a href="#Footnote_276_299" class="fnanchor">276</a> which in
acid solution, presumably, carries a positive charge<a id="FNanchor_277_300" href="#Footnote_277_300" class="fnanchor">277</a>: these
two colloids mutually precipitate each other in the presence of
hydrochloric acid.<a id="FNanchor_278_301" href="#Footnote_278_301" class="fnanchor">278</a></p>

<p>When the precipitate is treated with an alkaline liquid (ammonium hydroxide
solution), the charge on the stannic acid becomes negative, both colloids
acquire the same charge and the precipitate dissolves, to form the beautifully
tinted suspensions of colloidal gold (p. <a href="#p126">126</a>). In this condition the colloids
(gold and stannic acid) are sensitive to precipitating electrolytes, and the
solution is more sensitive to a mixture of magnesium nitrate and ammonium
nitrate than to ammonium nitrate alone (<em class="italic">exp.</em>), as is to be expected from a
<em class="italic">negative</em> suspension (see below).</p>

<p>The characteristic difference in behavior between <em class="italic">ortho-</em>, <em class="italic">pyro-</em> and <em class="italic">metaphosphoric
acids</em> toward albumen, which is used as a characteristic analytical
test to distinguish metaphosphoric acid from the other two acids,<a id="FNanchor_279_302" href="#Footnote_279_302" class="fnanchor">279</a> appears to
be due to similar relations<a id="FNanchor_280_303" href="#Footnote_280_303" class="fnanchor">280</a>: metaphosphoric acid, which precipitates (coagulates)
albumen, is colloidal, ortho- and pyrophosphoric acids are not. The
<a id="p135" class="xxpn">[p135]</a> coagulation seems to be the result of the union of the <em class="italic">negative colloid</em> metaphosphoric
acid (or a complex negative colloidal ion thereof) with the <em class="italic">positive
colloid</em> albumen (or a positive colloidal ion thereof).</p></div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Precipitating Power of Electrolytes and the Valence of
their Ions.</h4>—The complete precipitation of colloids, which carry
electric charges, depends on the concentrations of the colloid and
the electrolyte; in this connection the important observation has
been made that the <em class="italic">precipitating power</em> of electrolytes <em class="italic">increases
decidedly with the valence of the precipitating ions</em> (H. Schulze's
rule<a id="FNanchor_281_304" href="#Footnote_281_304" class="fnanchor">281</a>). Bivalent ions are far more efficient than univalent; trivalent,
in turn, still more effective than bivalent.</div>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p>Thus, colloidal As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, carrying a negative charge, is precipitated by the
positive ions of added electrolytes. The addition of a few drops of a molar
solution of ammonium nitrate (the precipitating ion is NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) to 20 c.c. of
the colloidal suspension<a id="FNanchor_282_305" href="#Footnote_282_305" class="fnanchor">282</a> produces a slight precipitate; complete precipitation
requires 3.5 to 3.6 c.c. of the ammonium nitrate solution.<a id="FNanchor_283_306" href="#Footnote_283_306" class="fnanchor">283</a> Only 0.06 c.c.
of an equivalent solution<a id="FNanchor_284_307" href="#Footnote_284_307" class="fnanchor">284</a> of magnesium nitrate (the precipitating ion is Mg<sup>2+</sup>)
is required, and as little as 0.015 c.c. of an equivalent solution of aluminium
nitrate<a id="FNanchor_285_308" href="#Footnote_285_308" class="fnanchor">285</a> (the precipitating ion is Al<sup>3+</sup>) has the same effect (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). An increase
in valence of the <em class="italic">negative</em> ion, which is not the precipitating ion in this
case, does not affect the result appreciably: 3.5 c.c. of a solution<a id="FNanchor_286_309" href="#Footnote_286_309" class="fnanchor">286</a> of ammonium
sulphate, (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, equivalent to the solution of NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>, is also required for
the complete precipitation of the colloidal As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> (<em class="italic">exp.</em>), although the one contains
the univalent ion, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, the other the bivalent ion, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>.</p>

<p>Conversely, a <em class="italic">positively</em> charged colloid, like ferric hydroxide, may be
precipitated by much smaller quantities<a id="FNanchor_287_310" href="#Footnote_287_310" class="fnanchor">287</a> of bivalent negative ions than of
univalent ions, etc. <a id="p136" class="xxpn">[p136]</a></p></div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Nonprecipitation of Nonelectrified Colloids by Electrolytes.</h4>—Colloids
which do not carry any electric charges of moment
(see p. <a href="#p132">132</a>) are also not precipitated by dilute solutions of electrolytes.
Heat, the addition of concentrated salt solutions in
great excess (whose effect is probably a dehydrating one), or of
other solvents (<em class="italic">e.g.</em> alcohol), are the agents most commonly used
to effect coagulation in such cases.</div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Protective Action of Colloids on Other Colloids.</h4>—Colloids,
particularly such as are not sensitive to precipitation by electrolytes,
increase in a remarkable degree the stability of the colloidal
condition of substances, that carry electrical charges and, ordinarily,
would be very sensitive to precipitation. Thus, small quantities
of albumen are used to render colloidal silver preparations
more stable. Tannic acid, gelatine and albumen and related
compounds are frequently used as such protective agents. It is
supposed that they form protecting films around the colloidal
particles.</div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Applications in Analysis.</h4>—From the preceding discussion
we may now draw the following conclusions concerning the consideration
that is to be given to the colloidal condition as a factor
in qualitative analysis. The <em class="italic">absence of electrolytes</em> in solution
must favor the production of the colloidal condition, which would
result in the nonprecipitation or "solution" and <em class="italic">consequent loss of</em>
substances, which it is intended to precipitate. Such absence of
electrolytes in solution is most likely to be met with, in the first
place, in the <em class="italic">washing</em> out of <em class="italic">precipitates</em>. When the larger part
of the mother liquor is washed away by the use of pure water,
many precipitates show a tendency to "run through a filter,"
forming colloidal suspensions in the pure water in the filter and
being again precipitated as the colloid mixes with the electrolytes
in the filtrate. Precipitates, showing this tendency to assume
the colloidal condition, are therefore washed with appropriate
solutions of electrolytes, rather than with pure water. Ammonium
nitrate solution is most frequently available in qualitative analysis,
because neither the ammonium-ion nor the nitrate-ion tends to
interfere with the subsequent examination of the solution. When
chloride-ion is not likely to interfere, ammonium chloride may be
used. Thus, the sulphides of the arsenic, copper and zinc groups
are washed with solutions containing ammonium nitrate (the
<a id="p137" class="xxpn">[p137]</a> chloride may be used for the zinc
group<a id="FNanchor_288_311" href="#Footnote_288_311" class="fnanchor">288</a>) rather than with pure
water (or pure hydrogen sulphide
water<a href="#Footnote_288_311" class="fnanchor">288</a>). In quantitative analysis,
aluminium hydroxide is also washed with ammonium nitrate
solution, silver chloride with acidulated (nitric acid) water, lead
sulphate with dilute sulphuric acid, etc.</div>

<p>In the second place, if precipitations are attempted either in
rather dilute solutions or in solutions of little ionized substances
(arsenious acid and hydrogen sulphide), the addition of an electrolyte
is frequently required <em class="italic">to insure precipitation</em>. Thus, the
presence of ammonium chloride, or nitrate, in excess, is helpful in
the precipitation of the sulphides of the zinc group; the addition
of hydrochloric acid (or other electrolyte) is required to effect the
precipitation of arsenious sulphide from a solution of the oxide
(p. <a href="#p126">126</a>).</p>

<p>In the next place, account must be taken, in analytical work,
of the fact that <em class="italic">colloids carry down</em> with them the <em class="italic">precipitating
ion</em> by which they are coagulated, a fact which may lead to the
<em class="italic">loss of ions</em> which, it is intended, should be kept in solution. To
a certain extent, this loss may also be avoided by insuring the
presence of electrolytes (acids, ammonium salts) in sufficient concentration
to cause the coagulation without the aid of the ions
which, it is intended, should not be precipitated. In view of
the much weaker precipitating power of univalent ions (of hydrochloric
acid, ammonium nitrate and chloride), as compared with
that of polyvalent ions, which may be present, the acid and ammonium
salts must not be used in too small concentrations. In
quantitative analysis, when conditions permit it, ammonium or
sodium sulphate is frequently substituted for the ammonium salts
of the univalent monobasic acids. The washing of the precipitated
colloid with such salt solutions gradually removes<a id="FNanchor_289_312" href="#Footnote_289_312" class="fnanchor">289</a> the ions
which are precipitated with the colloid and forms a further safeguard
against their loss. But this source of loss is avoided only
with great difficulty and is seldom absolutely removed.</p>

<p>Finally, the presence of <em class="italic">protective colloids</em>, especially of the
<a id="p138" class="xxpn">[p138]</a> gelatine and albumen type, may interfere so decidedly with the
common precipitation tests for ions, that <em class="italic">their destruction is imperative</em>,
before these tests can be applied with any degree of confidence.
Thus, the mixing of solutions (0.1 molar) of silver nitrate
and hydrochloric acid, each containing one per cent of gelatine,
fails to produce the ordinary, characteristic precipitate<a id="FNanchor_290_313" href="#Footnote_290_313" class="fnanchor">290</a> of silver
chloride, <em class="italic">the reaction which is used to determine the presence of the
silver-ion in systematic analysis</em>.</p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p>The mixture is opalescent and, in reflected light, looks opaque-white; on
somewhat prolonged standing a white <em class="italic">milk</em> is produced, but no precipitate.
When the mixture is boiled, the same deep white milk is formed, but no
coagulated precipitate, the mixture running unchanged through a filter.
Hydrogen sulphide converts the mixture into a similar suspension of the black
sulphide.</p></div>

This process of separation of substances, which do not pass through
membranes, from such as do, is called <em class="italic">dialysis</em>. It was first used by Graham,
<em class="italic">Trans. Royal Soc.</em>, London, <em class="bold">151</em>, 183–224 (1861) (<em class="bold">Stud.</em>).</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

Graham made the first extended investigations in this field: <em class="italic">Trans.
Royal Soc.</em>, <em class="bold">151</em>, 183 (1861); <em class="italic">J. Chem. Soc.</em> (London), <em class="bold">17</em>, 318 (1864) (<em class="bold">Stud.</em>).
He found that amorphous, gelatinous bodies like ferric hydroxide, aluminium
hydroxide, silicic acid, gelatine, glue, dextrin, caramel, albumen and similar
bodies do not pass through membranes and may be obtained by dialysis in
the <em class="italic">colloidal</em> condition. Such substances were called "colloids" by Graham,
the name referring to the Latin for gelatine. Substances which pass through
membranes readily were found by Graham to resemble in behavior such
bodies as are crystallizable when solid; such compounds were classified by
him as "crystalloids." That liquids containing substances in the colloidal condition
(<em class="italic">e.g.</em> arsenious sulphide, gold, silver and many other substances) may
be prepared by methods other than dialysis, was found later by many investigators
and, in a few cases, previous to Graham, <em class="italic">e.g.</em> by Faraday, <em class="italic">loc. cit.</em>

<p>It frequently happens that we have to deal, simultaneously, with
conditions of chemical and of physical equilibrium, obtaining in the
same system. For instance, a gas like carbon dioxide, in contact
with its saturated solution in water, is in equilibrium with the
dissolved carbon dioxide, and this, in turn, is in equilibrium with
its hydrate, carbonic acid. A substance may be distributed between
two solvents and show a different molecular weight in the
two (see p. <a href="#p018">18</a>); it may exist, in the one, primarily in polymeric
form, and only to a slight extent in the simple form, the two forms
being in equilibrium (chemical equilibrium). In the other solvent,
it may exist only in its simple molecular form, and this will be in
equilibrium with the same simple molecular form in the first solvent
(physical equilibrium). In matters dealing with the solubility
of electrolytes in water, and, therefore, in questions of their <em class="italic">precipitation</em>
or <em class="italic">solution</em>, such simultaneous conditions of chemical
and physical equilibrium are constantly occurring. Since qualitative
analysis deals to a very considerable extent with just such
precipitates of salts, acids and bases, these cases are of particular
importance to us.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Earlier Derivation of the Solubility-Product Principle.</h4>—A
very simple relation was derived by Nernst<a id="FNanchor_291_314" href="#Footnote_291_314" class="fnanchor">291</a> for the combined
conditions of chemical and of physical equilibrium, where difficultly
soluble electrolytes (precipitates) were concerned. We shall
develop the relation first for a simple salt, such as silver acetate.</div>

<p>When water is added to solid silver acetate, the salt will dissolve.
If an excess of the acetate is used, equilibrium will result
between the solid salt and its solution, when the solution is
saturated at the temperature used. As the salt dissolves, it is
more or less ionized, and in the saturated solution we have a
<a id="p140" class="xxpn">[p140]</a> condition of chemical equilibrium between the salt and its ions:</p>

<p>The concentration of a pure solid, as we have seen, may be

minor factor and negligible, we shall conclude, that, for saturated

acetate being a constant, the concentration of the nonionized or

<p>Further, if the assumption is made that the presence of foreign

either the molecular solubility, K<sub>mol. sol.</sub>, of silver acetate or its

<a id="p141" class="xxpn">[p141]</a> relation, which has been developed, would hold for saturated aqueous
solutions of silver acetate in the presence of foreign electrolytes,
as well as for a saturated, pure, aqueous solution. A single, simple
equation would thus express the conditions for simultaneous
chemical and physical equilibrium between a difficultly soluble
ionogen, of the type of silver acetate, and its saturated solutions,
at a given temperature, in the presence or the absence of foreign
electrolytes.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Solubility- or Ion-Product Principle.</h4>—We may formulate
this important conclusion by stating, that, <em class="italic">in saturated solutions
of silver acetate, the product of the concentrations of its ions has a
constant value at a given temperature</em>. Analogous relations may
be developed for the saturated solutions of other difficultly soluble
ionogens. The constant has been called the <em class="italic">solubility-product
constant</em> or the <em class="italic">ion-product constant</em> of the <em class="italic">ionogen</em>. For salts like
lead iodide PbI<sub>2</sub>, silver chromate Ag<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub>, etc., each molecule of
which forms more than one of a given ion, the concentration of such
an ion is raised, in the solubility-product, to the power corresponding
to the number of ions of this kind formed from a single molecule
of the electrolyte.<a id="FNanchor_292_315" href="#Footnote_292_315" class="fnanchor">292</a> Thus, lead iodide ionizes according to the
equation PbI<sub>2</sub> ⇄ Pb<sup>2+</sup> + 2 I<sup>−</sup> and, for a saturated solution of lead
iodide<a id="FNanchor_293_316" href="#Footnote_293_316" class="fnanchor">293</a> at a given temperature, [Pb<sup>2+</sup>] × [I<sup>−</sup>]<sup>2</sup> = K. For silver
chromate, ionizing according to the equation Ag<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub> ⇄ 2 Ag<sup>+</sup> + CrO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>,
the form of the solubility-product equation is [Ag<sup>+</sup>]<sup>2</sup> ×
[CrO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>] = K. In general, for a saturated solution of a difficultly
soluble salt at a given temperature <em class="italic">the product of the ion concentrations,
each raised to the power corresponding to the number of that
kind of ion formed from the ionization of one molecule of the salt, is
a constant</em>.</div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Criticism of the Derivation of the Principle.</h4>—Nernst developed
this important relation in 1889, shortly after the theory
of ionization was formulated. Since then, however, the soundness
of the theoretical development, on which it was based, has
been rendered open to question in a way that could hardly have
been foreseen at that early stage in the development of the theory
of ionization. In the first place, it is known now that the
ionization of easily ionizing substances (strong electrolytes) does
<a id="p142" class="xxpn">[p142]</a> not conform to the law of chemical equilibrium (<em class="italic">vide</em> p. <a href="#p108">108</a>); as
far as our present knowledge goes, the ratio in equation I is not
a constant, but grows <em class="italic">larger</em> with an increasing total concentration
of good electrolytes. In the present case, this total concentration
may be increased by the introduction of <em class="italic">foreign salts</em>.<a id="FNanchor_294_317" href="#Footnote_294_317" class="fnanchor">294</a> In the
second place, the second fundamental principle used, the principle
of the constant solubility of the dissolved molecular or non-ionized
salt, as expressed in equation III, was questioned and disproved
by Arrhenius in 1899. The molecular solubility depends
on the total concentration of salts in the solution and, in general,
decreases with increasing concentration of the total dissolved
salts. This result does not invalidate the law of physical equilibrium;
it merely means that the presence of salts, especially in
appreciable quantities, modifies the nature of the solvent and
changes its dissolving power, much as we have different dissolving
power shown by different pure solvents, such as water and alcohol.</div>

<p>It appears, however, that while the soundness of this theoretical
development of the relations expressed by the solubility-product
must be questioned, nevertheless as a <em class="italic">matter of experiment</em>,
the <em class="italic">product of the ion concentrations</em> of a difficultly soluble salt is
found, in dilute solutions, to be a constant, or sufficiently close to
a constant to satisfy all but the most rigorous requirements.<a id="FNanchor_295_318" href="#Footnote_295_318" class="fnanchor">295</a></p>

<p>It is, in fact, quite evident, that a <em class="italic">decreasing value for the second
term of the ratio I</em>—namely, for [CH<sub>3</sub>COOAg], the molecular solubility
of the salt—as the total concentration of the electrolytes
present increases, together with an <em class="italic">increasing value for the whole
ratio I</em> under the same conditions, are <em class="italic">not incompatible with a
constant value</em> of the first term of the ratio. That is, <em class="italic">the product of
the ion concentrations</em>, [CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>−</sup>] × [Ag<sup>+</sup>], <em class="italic">may well remain constant</em>
(equation IV), or approximately constant, in dilute salt solutions,
even if equations I and III do not hold for salt solutions. <a id="p143" class="xxpn">[p143]</a></p>

<p>Whether in the case of all difficultly soluble salts, as the total
salt concentration increases, the increasing values of the chemical
equilibrium ratio (equation I) will be so nicely balanced by the
decreasing values of the molecular solubility, that the first term
of the first ratio (the solubility-product) will always be constant,
is a question demanding further extended investigation.<a id="FNanchor_296_319" href="#Footnote_296_319" class="fnanchor">296</a> The
range of the investigation must be extensive, because it must
include several other classes<a id="FNanchor_297_320" href="#Footnote_297_320" class="fnanchor">297</a> of salts (<em class="italic">e.g.</em> Me<sub>2</sub>X, MeY<sub>2</sub>, etc.), for
which the first equation has a different form; for instance, for
Me<sub>2</sub>X,</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
[Me<sup>+</sup>]<sup>2</sup> × [X<sup>2−</sup>] / [Me<sub>2</sub>X] = K.
</div></div>

<p>For the present we must remain content with the result of the
past investigations and consider the principle of the constant
solubility-product to be essentially an empirical one. It is an
extremely convenient condensation, into a very simple mathematical
form, of the main factors involved in the precipitation and
solution of difficultly soluble salts, acids, and bases. It should
be used with due knowledge of its character and limitations.</p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p>Washburn<a id="FNanchor_298_321" href="#Footnote_298_321" class="fnanchor">298</a> derives the principle of the constancy of the solubility-product,
without involving in his derivation the relation between ions and nonionized
molecules—a relation which, as was stated above, deviates from the law of
chemical equilibrium. The deviation, it will be recalled (p. <a href="#p109">109</a>), is generally
supposed to be due to the fact that the fundamental kinetic assumption which
must be made to derive the law of chemical equilibrium from the kinetic
theory, the assumption that there should be none but negligible forces of
attraction and repulsion between the molecules (of a gas or solute) which are
in equilibrium, is not fulfilled in the case of solutions of strong electrolytes
(p. <a href="#p109">109</a>). According to Washburn, if it is assumed that the <em class="italic">ions</em> of an electrolyte
fulfill this fundamental condition and that only the nonionized <em class="italic">molecules</em>
do not—the latter causing the deviation from the law of chemical equilibrium—then
the principle of the solubility-product constant follows.<a id="FNanchor_299_322" href="#Footnote_299_322" class="fnanchor">299</a> He
sees an approximate confirmation of the assumption made, in the fact that
the principle is found, empirically, to be true, and that other relations, developed
on the basis of the same assumption, agree with the observations
made. <a id="p144" class="xxpn">[p144]</a></p>

<p>This theoretical derivation of the principle, like the derivations of the
law of chemical equilibrium and of all our laws of dilute solutions, assumes<a id="FNanchor_300_323" href="#Footnote_300_323" class="fnanchor">300</a>
that the nature of the solvent, and consequently of the solution-process, is not
changed by added substances, for instance by an excess of the precipitating
ionogen. There can be no question, however, that the nature of the solvent
must change, as a <em class="italic">continuous function</em>, by the addition of electrolytes to
solutions. The changed solubilities of inert gases in salt solutions,<a id="FNanchor_301_324" href="#Footnote_301_324" class="fnanchor">301</a> and a
mass of other evidence,<a id="FNanchor_302_325" href="#Footnote_302_325" class="fnanchor">302</a> lead to this conclusion. The addition of a half
mole of sodium chloride to a liter of water reduces the dissolving power of the
liquid towards oxygen at 25° by 15%, <em class="italic">i.e.</em> by 30% per mole of salt. A weak
electrolyte, such as acetic acid, has practically no effect at this concentration,
and so the effect must be chiefly due to the ions of sodium chloride; since the
salt, in half-molar solution, is ionized 73%, the reduction in the dissolving
power would be 30 / 0.73 = 41% per mole of fully ionized salt. The principle
of the constant solubility-product cannot be considered as established for
solutions more concentrated than 0.2 to 0.3 molar; but it is evident that,
in any comprehensive theoretical formulation of the principle for the range
in which it is found empirically to hold, the change in the nature of the solvent,
which in some cases is conspicuous in 0.5 molar solution, must be taken into
consideration as a factor even in more dilute solutions (say 0.05 to 0.3 molar).
It seems at present, quite possible, perhaps even probable, that the constancy,
in all but the most dilute solutions, is the result of the approximate balancing of
two (or more) opposing factors.<a id="FNanchor_303_326" href="#Footnote_303_326" class="fnanchor">303</a> When we leave the range of concentrations
mentioned, and go to more concentrated solutions, these factors seem to be
less well balanced and the validity of the principle ceases.<a id="FNanchor_304_327" href="#Footnote_304_327" class="fnanchor">304</a> For the present
it will be safe to consider the principle as an empirical one, holding for solutions
of total salt content up to 0.25 or 0.3 molar.<a id="FNanchor_305_328" href="#Footnote_305_328" class="fnanchor">305</a> For quite dilute solutions the
effect of the electrolyte on the solvent would be negligible, and only to such
solutions would the theoretical derivation brought forward by Washburn be
applicable.</p></div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Influence of a Common Ion.</h4>—For a saturated aqueous
solution of silver acetate at a given temperature, the product of
<a id="p145" class="xxpn">[p145]</a> the ion concentrations may be considered a constant,
[CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>−</sup>] × [Ag<sup>+</sup>] = K<sub>S.P.</sub>.</div>

<p>In such an aqueous solution, containing no foreign salts, the
concentration of the silver-ion is equal to the concentration of
the acetate-ion, since a molecule of silver acetate, when it ionizes,
gives one silver ion for every acetate ion formed. The numerical
value of the solubility-product may then be calculated, if the
solubility of the salt and its degree of ionization are known.
For instance, at 16° one liter of water dissolves 10.07 grams of
silver acetate, that is, 10.07 / 167, or 0.0603 gram-molecule (mole).
Conductivity measurements show that 70.8% of the salt is
ionized in such a solution, and consequently the concentration
of the silver-ion is 0.708 × 0.0603, or 0.0427. The concentration
of the acetate-ion is the same, and the value of the solubility-product
constant, obtained by inserting these quantities in the
above equation, is K<sub>S.P.</sub> = 0.0427 × 0.0427 = 0.00182.</p>

<p>Now, if, to the saturated solution of the silver acetate, there are
added a few drops of a concentrated solution of sodium acetate
or some crystals of solid sodium acetate, the concentration of the
acetate-ion is thereby increased and the condition of equilibrium
in the solution is disturbed:</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
<em class="italic">x</em> [CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>−</sup>] × [Ag<sup>+</sup>] &gt; K<sub>S.P.</sub>.
</div></div>

<p class="continue">The concentration of the acetate-ion having been increased, the
ion will combine more rapidly than before with the silver-ion,
and the concentration of the <em class="italic">nonionized salt</em> will be <em class="italic">increased</em>.
The solution being already saturated with nonionized silver
acetate, the excess formed must be <em class="italic">precipitated</em>. As a matter
of fact, a precipitate of silver acetate is readily obtained in this
way (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). Precipitation will cease when sufficient silver acetate
has crystallized out to make the product of the concentrations
of the ions again equal to the solubility-product constant. If,
after the crystallization is complete and equilibrium has been
reëstablished, the acetate-ion is <em class="italic">x′</em> times as concentrated as it
was in the pure aqueous solution, the concentration of the silver-ion
must be reduced to 1 / <em class="italic">x′</em> its original value:</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
<em class="italic">x′</em> [CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>−</sup>] × [Ag<sup>+</sup>] / <em class="italic">x′</em> = K<sub>S.P.</sub>.
</div></div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Precipitation.</h4>—We see thus that <em class="italic">precipitation</em> of a difficultly

of the other ion (or ions) of the salt</em>. This fact is a very important
one in analytical chemistry and it is taken advantage of in many
ways, as we shall presently see.</div>

<p>It is clear that a corresponding result should be obtained
when, to the saturated aqueous solution of silver acetate, an
excess of the silver-ion is added—for instance by the addition
of solid silver nitrate or of a little of a concentrated
solution of this salt (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). Here
again, the product of the ion concentrations is greater

<div class="h4p"><h4>Applications in Analysis.</h4>—A few instances of the application
of this relation in analysis follow. The determination of the
sulphate-ion is based on the precipitation of barium sulphate from
solutions of sulphates. The solubility of barium sulphate in
water at 18° is 0.0023 gram, or 0.0023 / 233 = 1E−5 mole per
liter. In such an extremely dilute solution, the salt may be
considered to be completely ionized, and the value of the solubility-product
constant is found from K<sub>S.P</sub> = [Ba<sup>2+</sup>] × [SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>] = (1E−5)<sup>2</sup>,
or 1E−10. Now, the amount of sulphate-ion left in
solution, which would be about one milligram per liter of the
aqueous solution, may be reduced by the use of a small excess
of the precipitant, barium chloride. An excess of as little as 0.2
gram or 0.001 mole of BaCl<sub>2</sub> per liter would increase the concentration
of the barium-ion about one hundredfold, and barium
sulphate would be precipitated, until the concentration of the
sulphate-ion had been reduced about one hundredfold. The
loss of the sulphate-ion is thus reduced to approximately 0.01
milligram per liter.</div>

<p>In passing, we may ask what the approximate loss of dissolved
nonionized barium sulphate would amount to. The value of
the ratio ([Ba<sup>2+</sup>] × [SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>]) : [BaSO<sub>4</sub>],
representing the ionization of
barium sulphate, is unknown for the extreme dilution represented
<a id="p148" class="xxpn">[p148]</a> by the saturated solution. If we assume it to be roughly of the
order 2000 : 1,<a id="FNanchor_309_332" href="#Footnote_309_332" class="fnanchor">309</a> the solubility of nonionized barium sulphate at
18° would be roughly 0.05 milligram per liter.</p>

<p>As a rule, then, in the absence of complicating conditions,<a id="FNanchor_310_333" href="#Footnote_310_333" class="fnanchor">310</a> an
excess of the precipitant promotes the complete precipitation of
an ionogen.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Washing of Precipitates.</h4><a id="FNanchor_311_334" href="#Footnote_311_334" class="fnanchor">311</a>—When barium sulphate has been
brought on the filter and the excess of precipitant is to be washed
out, then, as the excess of barium chloride is removed, the sulphate
becomes more soluble again. It is advisable, therefore, to
wash the precipitate as effectively as possible with a very small
volume of water—as a rule, the water is used in a very fine
stream or is applied drop by drop.</div>

<p>Such precautions are still more important in the case of precipitates
which are somewhat more soluble than is barium sulphate,
and in such cases the question must be considered, whether
as a washing fluid, some solution may not be used, which contains
an ion in common with the precipitate, and which has, therefore,
according to the principle of the solubility-product, a very much
smaller dissolving power for the precipitate in question than pure
water. That is a resource of the analyst to which recourse is
occasionally taken. Lead sulphate, for instance, is washed with
a very dilute solution of sulphuric acid, rather than with pure
water;<a id="FNanchor_312_335" href="#Footnote_312_335" class="fnanchor">312</a> potassium cobaltinitrite, K<sub>3</sub>Co(NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>, which is used in
the separation of cobalt from nickel, is washed<a id="FNanchor_313_336" href="#Footnote_313_336" class="fnanchor">313</a> with a ten per
cent solution of potassium acetate, containing a little potassium
nitrite. Ammonium phosphomolybdate, used in determinations
of phosphates, is washed with a solution of ammonium nitrate. <a id="p149" class="xxpn">[p149]</a></p>

<p>The use of such solutions for washing precipitates is limited by
the necessity, first, of avoiding salts which interfere with subsequent
operations (<em class="italic">e.g.</em> which would leave nonvolatile residues in
the subsequent ignition of a precipitate, that is to be weighed after
ignition) and, second, of avoiding the loss of precipitate by the
formation of complex ions between an ion of the precipitate and a
component of the washing mixture (see p. <a href="#p148">148</a>). But wherever
such complications can be excluded, the method is a desirable one.</p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p>It has sometimes been recommended to wash a precipitate with a <em class="italic">saturated</em>
aqueous solution of the precipitate itself, in place of with pure water.
It was reasoned that the solution, being already saturated with the salt,
would not be able to dissolve any of the precipitate obtained. That is true;
but if a saturated solution of a salt, MeX, is placed on a filter still holding
an excess of the precipitant, <em class="italic">i.e.</em> one of the ions, say X, of the precipitate,
then this excess may cause supersaturation of the saturated washing fluid
and some of the salt may be precipitated out of the washing fluid. The
method, as commonly employed, has therefore the inherent fault, theoretically
at least, of being liable to give too high results. If it is to be employed
without error, precautions must be taken first to remove, from the precipitate
and filter, the mother liquor (containing the excess of precipitant) as completely
as possible. If in a given case this can be accomplished, then the
danger of precipitating any of the salt (MeX) from the saturated solution is
avoided, and the precipitate (MeX ↓) may then be further washed with a
saturated solution of the same salt (MeX), with advantage, in certain cases.
Thus, in the Lindo-Gladding method<a id="FNanchor_314_337" href="#Footnote_314_337" class="fnanchor">314</a> of determining potassium in the form
of potassium chloroplatinate, the source of error, just discussed, has been
avoided in the following way: the excess of precipitant, chloroplatinic acid
H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub>, which has the ion PtCl<sub>6</sub><sup>2−</sup> in common with the precipitate, is <em class="italic">first
removed</em> from the precipitate by thorough washing of the precipitate with
alcohol; subsequently, other impurities, <em class="italic">e.g.</em> sulphates, soluble in water but not
in alcohol, are washed out with an aqueous solution of ammonium chloride<a id="FNanchor_315_338" href="#Footnote_315_338" class="fnanchor">315</a> that
has been saturated with potassium chloroplatinate. The method gives good
results.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Solubility-Product in Volumetric Analysis.</h4>—A final instance of the
application of the solubility-product principle to the ordinary methods of
analytical chemistry, may be taken from the field of quantitative, volumetric
analysis. A particularly accurate method of determining silver consists in
precipitating it as silver chloride by means of a standardized solution of
sodium chloride. The aim of the method is to recognize, as exactly as
<a id="p150" class="xxpn">[p150]</a> possible,
the point where the action AgNO<sub>3</sub> + NaCl → AgCl ↓ + NaNO<sub>3</sub> has just
completed itself, <em class="italic">i.e.</em> where one equivalent of sodium chloride has been added
for just one equivalent of silver nitrate present. A very sensitive method<a id="FNanchor_316_339" href="#Footnote_316_339" class="fnanchor">316</a>
depends on the fact that silver chloride can be made to coagulate by the vigorous
shaking of its suspensions, and that the coagulated chloride settles
rapidly, leaving a clear supernatant liquid, in which the appearance of the
faintest turbidity may be recognized, when the sodium chloride solution is
carefully added to the silver nitrate solution under investigation. Now,
when sodium chloride solution is added in this way to silver nitrate, a point
is reached (called the "neutral point"),<a id="FNanchor_317_340" href="#Footnote_317_340" class="fnanchor">317</a> where the addition of a further drop
or two of sodium chloride solution will still produce a precipitate, and where
one would be inclined to decide that too little of the chloride had been used
to complete the action. But, at the same time, the addition of a few drops
of silver nitrate solution to the solution at the "neutral point" also produces
a precipitate of silver chloride, seemingly indicating that an excess of sodium
chloride had been used, and apparently contradicting the previous result.
As a matter of fact, such a behavior is exactly what is to be expected from
a solution, when exactly equivalent quantities of silver nitrate and sodium
chloride have been brought together in solution. The solution is then saturated
with silver chloride, K<sub>S.P.</sub> = [Ag<sup>+</sup>] × [Cl<sup>−</sup>] and [Ag<sup>+</sup>] = [Cl<sup>−</sup>], and the
further addition <em class="italic">either</em> of the silver-ion (silver nitrate) <em class="italic">or</em> of the chloride-ion
(sodium chloride) should produce a precipitate, according to the principle of
the solubility-product. The correct end-point in the determination is, thus,
the "neutral point," for at that point the quantity of silver present is equivalent
to the quantity of sodium chloride added.</div></div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Effect of Electrolytes with No Ion in Common with the Precipitate.</h4>—In
the precipitation of silver acetate from its saturated
solution by the addition of sodium acetate (p. <a href="#p145">145</a>), it is the acetate-ion,
according to the principle of the solubility-product, which
is effective—the sodium-ion has no part in the action. Also, in a
similar way, the precipitation produced by the addition of silver
nitrate is ascribed to the increased concentration of the silver-ion—the
nitrate-ion has no share in the action. We may ask, what the
effect on the solubility of silver acetate will be, if a salt, sodium
nitrate, yielding <em class="italic">only foreign ions</em>, and no common one, is added
to its saturated solution. The presence of sodium and of nitrate
ions will not increase the concentration of either of the ions of
silver acetate, will not increase the value of either factor in
the product of ion concentrations; the addition of sodium nitrate,
therefore, should not lead to the precipitation of any silver acetate,
and as a matter of experiment it does not (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). A closer study
<a id="p151" class="xxpn">[p151]</a> of the conditions will show, in fact, that it renders silver acetate
somewhat <em class="italic">more soluble</em>. The addition of the sodium-ion will lead
to the suppression of some of the acetate-ion, nonionized sodium
acetate being formed to a certain extent; the nitrate-ion will combine
with some of the silver-ion to form nonionized silver nitrate:
thus the concentrations of both of the ions of silver acetate <em class="italic">are reduced</em>,
and the product of ion concentrations is rendered smaller than
the solubility-product constant,
<span class="ibnowrap">([CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>−</sup>] − <em class="italic">x</em>) ×</span> <span class="ibnowrap">([Ag<sup>+</sup>] − <em class="italic">y</em>) &lt; K<sub>S.P.</sub>.</span></div>

<p>Since the concentrations of both the silver and the acetate ions
are reduced, they will not combine as rapidly as before to form nonionized
silver acetate, and the conditions of equilibrium between
the latter and its ions must be disturbed. The nonionized salt
ionizes, for a moment, more rapidly than it is formed and its concentration
will thus be reduced. We, therefore, might expect the
solution to become <em class="italic">unsaturated</em> in respect to the nonionized form,
and the solid salt, if present, should go into solution. In other
words, the addition of a salt with two foreign ions should <em class="italic">increase
the solubility of a difficultly soluble salt</em> (it is understood that
no salt is used which would precipitate a new, less soluble salt).
This expectation has also been fully confirmed by careful quantitative
determinations, especially by A. A. Noyes and his collaborators.
The effect may be demonstrated more easily by the
addition to silver acetate of an electrolyte which will very
thoroughly suppress one of its ions. Nitric acid is such an agent.
The hydrogen-ion will very decidedly reduce the concentration of
the acetate-ion, acetic acid being a weak acid (table, p. <a href="#p104">104</a>).
There is no difficulty in recognizing the anticipated effect (<em class="italic">exp.</em>).</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Solution of Precipitates.</h4>—We find, then, that <em class="italic">when the product
of the ion concentrations of a difficultly soluble salt becomes smaller
than the solubility-product constant, the solution is unsaturated</em> in
regard to the salt, and <em class="italic">the solid salt</em>, if present, <em class="italic">will go into solution</em>.</div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Summary.</h4>—The conclusions concerning the application of
the solubility-product constant may be summarized as follows:
A solution is saturated with a difficultly soluble ionogen when the
product of the concentrations of the ions of the ionogen is equal to
the characteristic solubility-product constant (at the given temperature).
A solution is supersaturated and precipitation will follow, if
the product of the ion concentrations is greater than the constant.
<a id="p152" class="xxpn">[p152]</a> (See p. <a href="#p122">122</a> in regard to precautions against prolonged supersaturation.)
A solution is unsaturated, and the ionogen, if present,
will dissolve when the product of the ion concentrations is smaller
than the constant.</div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Further Considerations Concerning Precipitation and Solution.</h4>—It
is further evident that precipitation is favored, if the
precipitating agent contains an electrolyte which produces the
precipitating ion readily; for instance, carbonic acid does not
precipitate any barium carbonate from a solution of barium
chloride (<em class="italic">exp.</em>)—carbonic acid being an exceedingly weak acid
and producing only a minute concentration of the carbonate-ion
CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup>, necessary for the precipitation; but sodium carbonate, a
readily ionized salt, will precipitate the barium carbonate quantitatively
(p. <a href="#p090">90</a>). If some alkali is added to the mixture of
barium chloride and carbonic acid (<em class="italic">exp.</em>), the latter is converted
into a readily ionized salt, the concentration of the carbonate-ion
is thus decidedly increased, and the precipitate forms instantly.
In the same way, if hydrogen sulphide—a still weaker
acid (table, p. <a href="#p104">104</a>), which forms only minute quantities of sulphide
and hydrosulphide ions (S<sup>2−</sup> and HS<sup>−</sup>)—is passed through
a solution of ferrous sulphate, it fails to precipitate ferrous sulphide;
but a salt of hydrogen sulphide, ammonium sulphide, for
instance, precipitates ferrous sulphide quantitatively (<em class="italic">exp.</em>).</div>

<p>On the other hand, solution of an ionogen is evidently favored
and its precipitation rendered more difficult, if we suppress one
(or both) of its ions. Thus barium phosphate, calcium carbonate,
silver borate, and many salts of weak acids, that are very difficultly
soluble in water, are quite easily soluble in strong acids,
which suppress the anions by converting them into little ionized
acids. When a precipitate is dissolved by the addition of a
reagent, such as an acid, an alkali, ammonia, ammonium sulphide—chemical
solvents most frequently used in analytical
work—we may, as a general principle, consider that the reagent
must affect one or both of the ions of the precipitate in question,
suppressing it (or them) and thereby making solution possible.
The problem of determining in what way the suppression of the
ion is effected, must then be faced. Many occasions to determine
such questions<a id="FNanchor_318_341" href="#Footnote_318_341" class="fnanchor">318</a> will arise. <a id="p153" class="xxpn">[p153]</a></p>

<p>We have, therefore, a certain degree of control over the precipitation
and solution of electrolytes, the control depending upon,
and being limited by, the fact that the <em class="italic">factors of the product of ion
concentrations are variables</em>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we have little control, in a given solvent,
over the question of solution or precipitation as affected by the
value of the ion product <em class="italic">constant</em>, the remaining term in the equation
of the solubility-product for saturated solutions. These constants
cover a very wide range of values for the various salts,
which are most frequently used in analytical work for the precipitation
of the common ions.<a id="FNanchor_319_342" href="#Footnote_319_342" class="fnanchor">319</a> They are subject to variation
with the temperature, and, as a rule, as most salts are more soluble
at higher than at lower temperatures, the values of the constants
increase with the temperature. For exceedingly difficultly soluble
salts, the increase is commonly of no practical moment in analytical
work, when, by an excess of the precipitant, the ion, which is to
be precipitated, can be precipitated quantitatively; the solubility
of the nonionized salt, that is precipitated, is so minute (see
p. <a href="#p148">148</a>) in this case, even at high temperatures, that it is altogether
negligible for ordinary purposes.<a id="FNanchor_320_343" href="#Footnote_320_343" class="fnanchor">320</a> On the other hand, precipitates
are often used which are not at all extremely insoluble
but merely rather difficultly soluble; they are used in spite of their
relatively slight insolubility because they are the best available
forms for our purposes. Such salts are, for instance, lead chloride,
magnesium-ammonium phosphate, potassium chloroplatinate.
When these are precipitated, not only must the fact that they
are appreciably soluble at ordinary temperature be taken into
account, but also the fact that they are very much more soluble
at higher temperatures. Lead chloride and potassium chloroplatinate
are, for instance, quite soluble in hot water.</p>

<p>As a rule, we select for the form in which a given ion is to be
precipitated, a form which, in a saturated aqueous solution, shows
the <em class="italic">smallest concentration of the ion in question</em>. But if no form is
<a id="p154" class="xxpn">[p154]</a> known which is sufficiently insoluble to give satisfactory quantitative
results, then we have recourse to a <em class="italic">change</em> in the <em class="italic">solvent</em>.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Solubility and Solvent.</h4>—For instance, a mixture of alcohol
and water may be used, or water be excluded altogether; and
either absolute (water-free) alcohol or a mixture of alcohol and
ether may be employed. In the quantitative treatment of potassium
chloroplatinate, the last-named mixture is used in place of
water. The change of solvent affects the solubility by a change
both in the solubility of the ionized portion of a salt and in
that of the nonionized salt. An important quantitative relation
between the solubility of a given ionogen in different solvents
and the ionizing powers of the solvents, as determined by their
dielectric constants (p. <a href="#p063">63</a>), was predicted, on the basis of theoretical
considerations, by Malström<a id="FNanchor_321_344" href="#Footnote_321_344" class="fnanchor">321</a> and by Baur.<a id="FNanchor_322_345" href="#Footnote_322_345" class="fnanchor">322</a> Walden<a id="FNanchor_323_346" href="#Footnote_323_346" class="fnanchor">323</a> has
furnished experimental confirmation of the relation: <em class="italic">The degree of
ionization of a salt is found to be the same in its saturated solutions
in different solvents</em>, when the solutions are saturated at the same
temperature.</div>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p>In view of the difficulties in determining the values for the dielectric constant,
the agreement in the values of the last column must be considered satisfactory.<a id="FNanchor_325_348" href="#Footnote_325_348" class="fnanchor">325</a></p>

<p>This important principle forms another striking instance of the <em class="italic">supreme
influence of electrical relations in determining the behavior of ionogens in
solution</em> (see p. <a href="#p111">111</a>).</p></div>

<p>Since, in solutions saturated at the same temperature with a
given ionogen, the degree of ionization of the ionogen is the same
in both solvents, the proportion of nonionized to ionized salt is
also the same. If a salt, <em class="italic">e.g.</em> calcium sulphate, is less soluble in
alcohol than in water, the alcohol must hold less of the nonionized
form, as well as less of the ionized salt, than does an equal
volume of water at the same temperature.</p>

<p>The development of further relations, of fundamental importance
to analytical chemistry, with the aid of the laws of chemical and
physical equilibrium and of the principle of the solubility-product,
will be taken up in the study of the reactions of the various analytical
groups of ions.</p>

Owing to the possibility of the formation of complex ions (Chapter XII),
each individual case must be considered by itself and the most favorable conditions
for the complete precipitation determined experimentally. The rule
mentioned is to be used as a guide, and the reference to the possibility of
the formation of complex ions considered as a warning, in the planning of
such investigations.</p></div>

<div class="xxpn"><a id="p157" class="xxpn">[p157]</a>
<a href="#Contents">TOC</a></div>

<p>In systematic analysis it is most convenient to make separate
examinations for the metal and for the acid ions. The examination
for metal ions usually precedes that for the acid ions, and the
scheme of analysis for the former will be considered first.</p>

<p>The analytical grouping of the metallic elements is not a natural
one, as far as their chemical behavior is concerned. Such a
grouping is found in the Periodic System of Mendeléeff and is
used in systematic inorganic chemistry.<a id="FNanchor_326_349" href="#Footnote_326_349" class="fnanchor">326</a> The groups in analysis
are based chiefly, but not exclusively, on the physical property
of greater or smaller solubility of certain salts of the metals.
According to the salts chosen, different systems vary somewhat
in detail. Frequently elements of the same natural family are
also found in the same analytical group, relationship in chemical
properties being often coincident with relationship in the physical
behavior of the salts of the metals.</p>

<p>In the following list, the common metal ions are arranged
in groups, which are given in the order in which they are precipitated
in the method of systematic analysis adopted. In each
case, a group name and the characteristic reagents used in separating
a group from those following it, are given.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Silver Group.</h4>—Ions whose chlorides are

<p>In considering the analytical reactions and the analysis of these
groups of metal ions, we shall take up the groups in the order
reversed to that given in the table. We shall begin with the group
of alkali metals, follow this group with the alkaline earths, then
take the aluminium and zinc groups, the copper and silver groups,
and finish with the arsenic group. This order is chosen because
the chemistry of the reactions involved is simplest in the groups
to be studied first and grows more complicated as we advance to
those to be studied later.</p>

<p>It is not intended to discuss in detail all the reactions and
methods; our attention will be limited rather to the study of
<em class="italic">typical general relations</em>, and the student is expected to acquire
the power to apply the general conclusions reached, to any specific
case demanding it. <a id="p159" class="xxpn">[p159]</a></p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Alkali Group.</h4>—The group includes the ions of <em class="bold">sodium</em>
and <em class="bold">potassium</em>, the most common and most important of the alkali
metals, and the <em class="bold">ammonium</em>-ion. Characteristic of the ions of the
group is the fact that all of their common salts are easily soluble
in water. They remain in solution in systematic analysis, while
other metal ions are removed in the form of various insoluble
precipitates.</div>

<p>The ammonium-ion is recognized, and may be removed from a
mixture of the salts of the group, on the basis of a fundamental
distinction in its chemical behavior, namely its instability and the
instability of its compounds. Sodium-ion and potassium-ion, are
recognized, and separated from each other, by physical methods.
All ammonium compounds, NH<sub>4</sub>X, decompose more or less
readily into ammonia and the free acids,<a id="FNanchor_328_351" href="#Footnote_328_351" class="fnanchor">328</a> according to the reversible
reaction,</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
NH<sub>4</sub>X ⇄ NH<sub>3</sub> + HX.
</div></div>

<p>The stronger the acid combined with ammonia, the more stable
is the salt, and the higher is the temperature, at which the salt
decomposes readily and rapidly. Ammonium chloride, one of the
most stable of the salts, is decomposed rapidly only at about
350°, which is, however, still below red heat; ammonium carbonate,
the salt of a very much weaker acid, decomposes appreciably
at ordinary temperatures, and exposed to the air, it
gradually disappears as ammonia, carbon dioxide and water. If
the acid of the salt is volatile at the dissociation temperature of
the salt, the whole salt is volatilized, and if the ammonia and
volatile acid vapor reach a colder space, recombination to form the
original solid salt occurs to a considerable extent (the "smoking
off" of ammonium chloride). If the acid is not volatile, the salt,
nevertheless, loses its ammonia at temperatures below red heat,
while the acid remains. Sodium-ammonium phosphate, for instance,
when heated, loses its ammonia, and sodium-dihydrogen
phosphate is left as a nonvolatile residue.</p>

<p>Ammonium happens to form salts which closely resemble the
corresponding salts of potassium in physical properties, such as
<a id="p160" class="xxpn">[p160]</a> solubility and insolubility, salts which could readily be mistaken
for potassium salts. Advantage is taken of the chemical instability
of the ammonium salts, just described, to remove ammonium
completely from mixtures, by ignition, before tests for potassium
are made.</p>

<p>Water is a far weaker acid (see table, p. <a href="#p104">104</a>) than carbonic
acid and it is not surprising to find the compound formed by water
and ammonia, ammonium hydroxide, one of the least stable of the
ammonium compounds. Even at ordinary temperature, the hydroxide
is more or less decomposed, according to a reversible
reaction of the same type as that found for the ammonium salts,
NH<sub>4</sub>OH ⇄ NH<sub>3</sub> + HOH.</p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p>Chemists have always been interested in the problem of the exact degree
of stability of ammonium hydroxide, and, more particularly, in the problem
whether ammonia gives solutions in water showing very much weaker basic
strength<a id="FNanchor_329_352" href="#Footnote_329_352" class="fnanchor">329</a> than equivalent solutions of potassium and sodium hydroxides,
primarily <em class="italic">because only a small proportion of the ammonia is combined with
water to form the real base, ammonium hydroxide</em> (which would be present then
in much more dilute solution than the alkali metal hydroxides are in the
solutions with which the comparison is made), or chiefly <em class="italic">because ammonium
hydroxide is much less readily ionizable</em> than potassium or sodium hydroxide.</p>

<p>For the reversible action NH<sub>3</sub> + HOH ⇄ NH<sub>4</sub>OH we would have, at a
constant temperature, according to the law of chemical equilibrium,</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
[NH<sub>3</sub>] × [HOH] / [NH<sub>4</sub>OH] = <em class="italic">k</em>.
</div></div>

<p class="continue">For a dilute solution at a given temperature the concentration of the water
may be considered a constant, and therefore</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="EquationWLable">
[NH<sub>3</sub>] / [NH<sub>4</sub>OH] = <em class="italic">k</em> / [HOH] = <em class="italic">k</em><sub>NH<sub>3</sub></sub>.
</div>
<div class="equationlabel">(I)</div></div>

<p class="continue">For the ionization of ammonium hydroxide, NH<sub>4</sub>OH ⇄ NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> + HO<sup>−</sup>, we
would have in turn,</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="EquationWLable">
[NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>] × [HO<sup>−</sup>] / [NH<sub>4</sub>OH] = <em class="italic">k</em><sub>base</sub>.
</div>
<div class="equationlabel">(II)</div></div>

<p class="continue">This constant represents <em class="italic">the
real ionization constant of ammonium hydroxide as a base</em>,
and its approximate value has only recently been determined
by Moore<a id="FNanchor_330_353" href="#Footnote_330_353"
class="fnanchor">330</a> and found to be about 5E−5. The ratio
[NH<sub>3</sub>] / [NH<sub>4</sub>OH] was found to be approximately
2 at 20°. According to this result, ammonium hydroxide is really
a much weaker, less readily ionized base than potassium or sodium
hydroxide. The <em class="italic">efficiency of ammonium hydroxide
as a base</em> depends <a id="p161" class="xxpn">[p161]</a> on both
conditions of equilibrium; the first equation states what proportion
of ammonium hydroxide can exist, as such, in solution, if a given
amount of ammonia is dissolved in a given amount of water, and
the second equation shows the proportion of the hydroxide, which
is ionized. The equations may be combined<a id="FNanchor_331_354"
href="#Footnote_331_354" class="fnanchor">331</a> into one
expression,</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="EquationWLable">
[NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>] × [HO<sup>−</sup>] / ([NH<sub>4</sub>OH] + [NH<sub>3</sub>]) = K.
</div>
<div class="equationlabel">(III)</div>
</div>

<p class="continue">That is, <em class="italic">the ratio of</em> [NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>] × [HO<sup>−</sup>] <em class="italic">to the total concentration of nonionized
ammonium hydroxide and ammonia, is a constant</em>. This constant has the
value 0.000,018 at 18° (as given in the table, p. <a href="#p106">106</a>) and, as said, comprises in
a single expression a statement measuring the <em class="italic">efficiency</em>, as a base, of a solution
of ammonium hydroxide and ammonia in aqueous solutions. The concentration
of the hydroxide-ion, on which the efficiency as a base depends, can be
ascertained directly from the expression, provided we know the total concentration
of the ammonia and ammonium hydroxide and the concentration and
degree of ionization of any ammonium salt, which may be present with the
base (see p. <a href="#p161">161</a>). These data are easily obtained by direct measurement.</p></div>

<p>The instability of ammonium hydroxide is used as a means for
<em class="italic">detecting ammonium-ion</em> in its salts. The latter are treated with
some strong base, such as sodium or calcium hydroxide, and
the ammonia, liberated by the decomposition of its hydroxide, is
recognized by its odor or by the more sensitive test of its action
on moist litmus. The delicacy of the test is dependent on the
conditions expressed in the equilibrium equation (p. <a href="#p160">160</a>).</p>

<p>Sodium and potassium resemble each other so profoundly in the
chemical behavior of their compounds, that they are recognized,
and separated from each other, by <em class="italic">physical</em> methods. A very
simple physical test is based on the color of their heated vapors,
the color imparted to the nonluminous bunsen flame by the
introduction and volatilization of their salts. The sodium flame
is so intense that, if sodium is present in any quantity, the color
of its flame easily masks the faint color of potassium vapor. The
color of the flame is best examined, in such a case, with the aid of
a spectroscope, in which the light emitted by the two elements may
be readily recognized side by side, or with the aid of cobalt glass,
which absorbs the sodium light. <a id="p162" class="xxpn">[p162]</a></p>

<p>The ions of the two metals may be separated and identified by
means of difficultly soluble salts. There are so few of these in
the case of both ions, that recourse must be taken to the salts
of comparatively uncommon acids. <em class="italic">Potassium chloroplatinate</em>
K<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub>, precipitated by the addition of chloroplatinic acid H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub>
to concentrated solutions of potassium salts, gives very satisfactory
results, both in qualitative and in quantitative work. The
acid tartrate, KHC<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, the picrate, KC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>2</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, and the
cobaltinitrite, K<sub>3</sub>Co(NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>,<a id="FNanchor_332_355" href="#Footnote_332_355" class="fnanchor">332</a> are difficultly soluble and are sometimes
used to <em class="italic">identify potassium-ion</em>. The corresponding ammonium
salts are also difficultly soluble and resemble the potassium
salts, and ammonium-ion must therefore be removed, as stated
above, if present, before any of these precipitates may be used
for the identification of potassium-ion. In the case of sodium-ion,
recourse is taken to the salt of a still more uncommon acid;
<em class="italic">pyroantimonate of sodium</em>, Na<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, 6 aq., is sufficiently difficultly
soluble and characteristic to be used as a means of <em class="italic">identifying
sodium-ion</em>.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Alkaline Earth Group.</h4>—This group includes <em class="bold">magnesium</em>,
<em class="bold">calcium</em>, <em class="bold">strontium</em>, and <em class="bold">barium.</em> Chemically, the analogous compounds
of the four alkaline earths resemble one another so much,
that physical differences alone are used in their separation and
identification. For qualitative work, the colors of their heated
vapors,<a id="FNanchor_333_356" href="#Footnote_333_356" class="fnanchor">333</a> especially when examined in the spectroscope, give us
sensitive and reliable tests for their presence. The alkaline earth
ions, especially the ions of barium, strontium and calcium, form
a great number of insoluble salts, which may be used to separate
them from each other. Salts used for this purpose and the methods
of employing them are considered in detail in the laboratory work
(see Part III). Here some general principles, only, will be considered
in connection with the behavior of some of the most important
of the precipitates.</div>

<p>There is a very wide range in the degree of the insolubility of
such precipitates as are used in analysis. In the table at the end
of Part IV, the exact solubilities of the most important
<a id="p163" class="xxpn">[p163]</a> precipitates
of the alkaline earths are given, for 18°, in grams and moles
per liter. The values are instructive in a number of respects.</p>

<p>Inspection of the table shows which are the least soluble (in
molar terms), and therefore the best salts, for precipitating barium,
strontium and calcium, in order to insure the use of the most
sensitive tests for the ions of each of these metals. It also shows
which salts must be treated with special precautions to escape
error. It is further seen, that if the carbonates of these alkaline
earths are precipitated by a moderate excess of ammonium carbonate,
the addition of a sulphate (for instance ammonium sulphate),
to the filtrate from the precipitated carbonates, will only
precipitate barium sulphate, the only sulphate whose solubility (and
solubility-product) is smaller than that of the corresponding carbonate.
In the same way, calcium oxalate is the only oxalate of
these three alkaline earths that will be precipitated by ammonium
oxalate in the filtrate from the carbonates (see Part III in regard
to precautions against difficultly soluble double oxalates of magnesium).
Again, calcium sulphate is the only one of the sulphates,
which is sufficiently soluble in water to give an immediate <em class="italic">heavy</em>
precipitate, when the sulphates are shaken for a few moments with
water and the filtered solution is treated with a few drops of
ammonium oxalate solution.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Fractional Precipitation.</h4><a id="FNanchor_334_357" href="#Footnote_334_357" class="fnanchor">334</a>—If sulphuric acid is added to a
0.5 molar solution of the chloride either of barium, of strontium
or of calcium, the corresponding sulphate is precipitated. We
may ask which sulphate will be precipitated first, when sulphuric
acid is added, drop by drop, to a solution containing the three
chlorides. This problem, a case of the <em class="italic">fractional precipitation of
salts containing a common ion</em>, may be treated from the point of
view of the solubility-product principle as follows, the problem
being limited, for the sake of simplicity, to only two of the sulphates,
those of barium and strontium.</div>

<p>For a saturated solution of barium sulphate,<a
id="FNanchor_335_358" href="#Footnote_335_358"
class="fnanchor">335</a> at 18°, in contact with the solid salt, we

<p class="continue">That is, in a solution in equilibrium with both precipitates at 18°,

Silver chromate Ag<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub> is an intensely red precipitate, that is
rather difficultly soluble in water (<em class="italic">exp.</em>); a liter of water dissolves<a id="FNanchor_338_361" href="#Footnote_338_361" class="fnanchor">338</a>
0.0252 gram or 8E−5 mole at 18°. The concentration
of the silver-ion in the saturated solution is then 0.00016 mole.<a id="FNanchor_339_362" href="#Footnote_339_362" class="fnanchor">339</a>
Silver chloride AgCl, a white salt, is still less soluble in water, a
liter of water at 18° dissolving 0.00134 gram or 1E−5 mole, and
the concentration of the silver-ion in the saturated solution is,
therefore, only 1E−5 mole, as compared with 1.6E−4 in the saturated
silver chromate solution. If a mixture of potassium chromate
and potassium chloride, containing approximately equal
(0.01 molar) concentrations of the two salts, is prepared and silver
nitrate solution added, drop by drop, to the mixture, the first <em class="italic">permanent
precipitate</em> is the white silver chloride (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). However, as
the silver nitrate solution strikes the surface of the liquid, a red
precipitate of the chromate, mixed with chloride, is momentarily
seen, where the silver nitrate temporarily produces a <em class="italic">local excess</em>
of the precipitant. But the red precipitate disappears rapidly
and gives way to the white precipitate of the less soluble chloride.
The quantitative relations, which may be developed with the aid
of the principle of the solubility-product (see below), are such
that, if little chromate is used, it may serve as an

of the solution, being used as the indication that the precipitation
of the chloride is complete. Potassium chromate is used as
a favorite indicator in quantitative analysis, for this purpose.</p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p>The quantitative relations<a id="FNanchor_340_363" href="#Footnote_340_363" class="fnanchor">340</a> for the precipitation may be developed as follows:

<p>For a solution containing one or two drops (0.1 c.c.) of saturated potassium
chromate solution per 100 c.c., a proportion frequently used in quantitative
analysis, the concentration of the chromate-ion is approximately 2.5E−3 and
the chloride-ion will consequently be precipitated until [Cl<sup>−</sup>] = 3E−6. The
chief source of error in the method, then, will not be due to the incompleteness
of the prior precipitation of the chloride, but rather to the use of the small excess
of silver nitrate required to precipitate sufficient chromate to be visible.
This error may be avoided, and is avoided in very accurate work (<em class="italic">e.g.</em> in
water analysis), by determining, in a blank test, the amount of silver nitrate
required to show the change of tint of a pure chromate solution of the concentration
to be used in the titration and by titrating to this tint in the determination
of the chloride: the volume of silver nitrate (<em class="italic">e.g.</em> 0.2 c.c. of a 0.01
molar solution), required to produce the tint in the blank test, is subtracted
from the total volume of silver nitrate used in the chloride determination.</p></div>

<p>We find thus, that the <em class="italic">order</em> of <em class="italic">precipitation</em> of <em class="italic">difficultly soluble
salts, which contain a common ion</em> (fractional precipitation), is <em class="italic">subject
to the equilibrium conditions derived from the application of
the principle of the solubility-product to the salts in question</em>.<a id="FNanchor_341_364" href="#Footnote_341_364" class="fnanchor">341</a></p>

<p>It should be further noted that the condition of equilibrium
between two precipitates, containing a common ion, and a supernatant
liquid, depends on the concentrations <em class="italic">in the supernatant
liquid</em>, in the <em class="italic">liquid phase</em>, and not on the quantities of the solids
<a id="p167" class="xxpn">[p167]</a> present. This conclusion was first reached by Guldberg and
Waage, to whom we owe the law of mass action, and was
fully confirmed by them. The modern treatment of the subject
substitutes ion concentrations, i.e. the concentrations of the active
components,<a id="FNanchor_342_365" href="#Footnote_342_365" class="fnanchor">342</a> for the total concentrations used by these investigators.<a id="FNanchor_343_366" href="#Footnote_343_366" class="fnanchor">343</a></p>

<p>That the condition of equilibrium is dependent on the liquid
phase can easily be demonstrated if mercurous chloride and
mercurous hydroxide are selected as the two precipitates, in
order that we may follow changes of concentration in the liquid
phase by color changes. For the condition of equilibrium between
the two precipitates and the supernatant liquid we may develop
the relation</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Precipitation by a Weak Base in the Presence of its Salts.</h4>—Magnesium,
in contrast to the other alkaline earth metals, forms
very few difficultly soluble compounds. Magnesium-ammonium
phosphate, Mg(NH<sub>4</sub>)PO<sub>4</sub>, a double salt, is the most characteristic
precipitate for identifying it. Magnesium hydroxide, as the
table of solubilities shows, is also very difficultly soluble. It is
readily precipitated by potassium or sodium hydroxide, but
ammonium hydroxide, at best, precipitates it only incompletely<a id="FNanchor_345_368" href="#Footnote_345_368" class="fnanchor">345</a>
from solutions of its salts, and very commonly does not precipitate
it at all—namely, when ammonium salts in sufficient quantity
are present (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). This peculiar behavior of ammonium salts, in
interfering with the precipitation of magnesium hydroxide, puzzled
chemists for many years, and a number of "theories" were
offered in explanation of it. But they all proved untenable, and
the first adequate explanation, the one in accord with all the facts,
was only found after the development of the theory of ionization.
Its quantitative application to the case in question gives a perfect
insight into the relations, and brings important confirmation of
the correctness of its fundamental assumptions.<a id="FNanchor_346_369" href="#Footnote_346_369" class="fnanchor">346</a></div>

<p>The fact that ammonium salts prevent the precipitation of
magnesium hydroxide was formerly explained as being due to the
formation of "double salts," such as MgCl<sub>2</sub>,NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. It is true
that such double salts exist, but, if their formation should prevent
the precipitation of magnesium hydroxide, possibly by including
the magnesium as part of a negative ion or radical,<a id="FNanchor_347_370" href="#Footnote_347_370" class="fnanchor">347</a> MgCl<sub>3</sub>,
then the corresponding double salts of magnesium chloride with
potassium and sodium chloride (<em class="italic">e.g.</em> MgCl<sub>2</sub>,KCl), which are just
as stable as the ammonium salts, should show the same behavior;
but, as a matter of fact, the addition of potassium chloride does
not interfere with the precipitation of the hydroxide by either
<a id="p169" class="xxpn">[p169]</a> potassium hydroxide or ammonium hydroxide (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). So the
explanation is untenable. Obviously, a <em class="italic">specific interference of
ammonium salts with the precipitating power of ammonium hydroxide
is involved</em>. But that is exactly what the law of chemical equilibrium,
applied to the ionization of ammonium hydroxide, would
demand: As a weak base, which is little ionized in pure aqueous
solutions, it is <em class="italic">very much weaker as a base, produces a far smaller
concentration of the hydroxide-ion, when readily ionizable salts of
ammonium are added to the solution</em>,<a id="FNanchor_348_371" href="#Footnote_348_371" class="fnanchor">348</a> and the precipitation of
magnesium hydroxide, and of metal hydroxides in general, depends
on the concentration of the hydroxide-ion, which is a factor
in the solubility-products of bases.</p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p>The precipitation of magnesium hydroxide, in particular, depends on the
relation of the product [Mg<sup>2+</sup>] × [HO<sup>−</sup>]<sup>2</sup> to the solubility-product constant of
magnesium hydroxide. For the saturated aqueous solution, the product
[Mg<sup>2+</sup>] × [HO<sup>−</sup>]<sup>2</sup> is equal to the solubility-product constant, and from the
solubility of magnesium hydroxide (see the table) the value of the constant is
found to be 15E−12 at 18°. The concentration of magnesium-ion is 0.000,154
in this solution. In a 0.1 molar solution of magnesium sulphate, which
is ionized to the extent of 37.3%, the concentration of magnesium-ion is
0.0373, and it would require a concentration <em class="italic">greater</em> than 2E−5 of hydroxide-ion
to precipitate any magnesium hydroxide.<a id="FNanchor_349_372" href="#Footnote_349_372" class="fnanchor">349</a> Now, the concentration of the
hydroxide-ion, in an ammoniacal solution, can easily be reduced far below this
value by the addition of ammonium chloride, nitrate, sulphate or other readily
ionizable ammonium salt to the solution, and then magnesium hydroxide will
<em class="italic">not</em> be precipitated.</p>

<p>In solutions of ammonium hydroxide the concentration of hydroxide ion
for 18° is found from the relation [NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>] × [HO<sup>−</sup>] : ([NH<sub>4</sub>OH] + [NH<sub>3</sub>]) = 18E−6 (p. <a href="#p161">161</a>). (1) For ammonium hydroxide, for instance in 0.2 molar solution,
and in the absence of any ammonium salt, [HO<sup>−</sup>] = [NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>] = 0.0019.<a id="FNanchor_350_373" href="#Footnote_350_373" class="fnanchor">350</a> This
concentration of the hydroxide-ion should be more than sufficient to <em class="italic">precipitate</em>
magnesium hydroxide in a 0.1 molar solution of the sulphate.<a id="FNanchor_351_374" href="#Footnote_351_374" class="fnanchor">351</a></p>

<p><em class="smcap">Exp.</em> 100 c.c. of a mixture which should contain magnesium sulphate in

<a id="p170" class="xxpn">[p170]</a> This weight of the salt is dissolved in 50 c.c. of water and 50 c.c. of 0.4 molar
solution of ammonium hydroxide is added to it. Magnesium hydroxide is
<em class="italic">precipitated</em>. (The precipitation is incomplete because the ammonium sulphate,
formed in the reaction, reduces the ionization of ammonium hydroxide.)</p>

<p>(2) In the presence of 0.25 molar ammonium chloride, the chloride being
dissociated to the extent of 80%,<a id="FNanchor_352_375" href="#Footnote_352_375" class="fnanchor">352</a> the concentration of the hydroxide-ion in
a 0.2 molar ammonium hydroxide solution is reduced to 18E−6.<a id="FNanchor_353_376" href="#Footnote_353_376" class="fnanchor">353</a> According
to the above calculation this is <em class="italic">too small</em> a concentration to precipitate magnesium
hydroxide in a 0.1 molar solution of the sulphate.</p>

<p><em class="smcap">Exp.</em> 1.35 grams ammonium chloride (the weight corresponding to 100 c.c.
of a mixture containing ammonium chloride in 0.25 molar solution) is dissolved
in 50 c.c. of 0.4 molar ammonium hydroxide and 2.46 grams of magnesium
sulphate, dissolved as before in 50 c.c. of water, is added to the mixture.
<em class="italic">No precipitate</em> of magnesium hydroxide is formed.</p></div>

<p>In a similar fashion and for the same reason, ammonium salts
interfere more or less with the precipitation of other hydroxides,
for instance with the precipitation of manganous, nickelous,
cobaltous, ferrous, zinc, cupric and cadmium hydroxides. But
ammonium salts do not prevent the precipitation of aluminium,
chromium and ferric hydroxides, which are much less soluble
than the hydroxides just mentioned, and as much weaker bases,
(Chap. X) are also much less readily ionized. They are precipitated
by smaller concentrations of the hydroxide-ion than are
the hydroxides of the first group, and their precipitation may be
made quantitative.</p>

<p>The chemistry of the analytical reactions of the alkalies and
alkaline earths is extremely simple,—it is essentially the chemistry
of well-defined bases and their salts,—and the separations
and identifications, as we have seen, depend almost entirely on
physical differences rather than on chemical contrasts. In the
aluminium and zinc groups, which are precipitated together and
which will be discussed together, the chemistry of the reactions
becomes very much more complex. Therefore, we shall not, as
yet, consider the groups as a whole, but shall first discuss the important
analytical reactions of some compounds of aluminium.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Aluminium Hydroxide an Amphoteric
Hydroxide.</h4>—Whereas the hydroxides of the alkali and alkaline
earth metals are bases, pure and simple, aluminium hydroxide
shows the properties both of a base and of an acid; it is an <em
class="italic">amphoteric</em> hydroxide, the term "amphoteric"
indicating the combination of acid with basic properties in
any compound. Aluminium hydroxide dissolves in acids. From its
solution in hydrochloric acid, an <em class="italic">aluminium</em>
salt, aluminium chloride AlCl<sub>3</sub>, 6 H<sub>2</sub>O, is
obtained. It also combines with strong bases, dissolving for
instance in a solution of sodium hydroxide and forming an <em
class="italic">aluminate</em>, NaAlO<sub>2</sub>. The two salts
mentioned are typical representatives of the two series of salts,
which aluminium hydroxide is capable of forming. This dual character
of the hydroxide raises a number of interesting questions, which one
meets with quite frequently in the study of analytical reactions. One
may ask, first, how aluminium hydroxide can ionize both as an acid
and as a base; second, whether any reason can be given, why it should
show the dual nature; and third, if it is both base and acid, why it
does not neutralize itself.</div>

<p>According to the best knowledge we have on the subject,
the molecule of aluminium hydroxide has the following <em
class="italic">structure</em> or arrangement of its atoms:
Al(─O─H)<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>It is readily seen that the cleavage of the molecules
may produce, <a id="p172" class="xxpn">[p172]</a> either
aluminium and hydroxide ions, characteristic ions of a base,
or aluminate<a id="FNanchor_354_377" href="#Footnote_354_377"
class="fnanchor">354</a> and hydrogen ions, characteristic ions of an
acid:</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
Al<sup>3+</sup> + 3 <sup>−</sup>OH ⇄ Al(─0─H)<sub>3</sub> ⇄ AlO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> + H<sup>+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O.
</div></div>

<p>The ionization of the hydroxide both as an acid and as a base
is, thus, quite possible on the basis of the molecular structure
assigned to it. In fact, all of the so-called oxygen acids are
considered to be hydroxides—we have sulphuric acid, O<sub>2</sub>S(OH)<sub>2</sub>,
phosphoric acid, OP(OH)<sub>3</sub>, etc.,—exactly as the bases, Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>,
etc., are hydroxides.</p>

<p>That brings us to the second question, why aluminium hydroxide
should show this dual character, whereas, for instance, sodium
and magnesium hydroxides, which have similar structures, do not
show it. The best answer to this question is found when we consider
the properties of the elements and their derivatives in connection
with their position in the periodic or natural system of
elements, which shows the properties as (periodic) functions of the
atomic weights. In the second series of the elements,<a id="FNanchor_355_378" href="#Footnote_355_378" class="fnanchor">355</a> omitting the
zero group element neon and taking the elements in the order of
increasing atomic weights, we have sodium (23), magnesium (24),
aluminium (27), silicon (28), phosphorus (31), sulphur (32), and
chlorine (35.5). One of the properties that are shown to be functions
dependent on the atomic weight, is the property under discussion,
namely the tendency of the (highest) hydroxides of the
elements to ionize as bases or acids, respectively. It is clear that
the hydroxides of the elements with the lowest atomic weights in
the series, sodium and magnesium, show the most pronounced
tendency to ionize as bases; the hydroxides of the elements with
the highest atomic weights show the most pronounced tendency
to ionize as acids—perchloric acid, (HO)ClO<sub>3</sub>, and sulphuric
acid, (HO)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>2</sub>, belong to the strongest acids. In accordance
with the underlying principle of the periodic system, the change of
<a id="p173" class="xxpn">[p173]</a> properties, in going from one extreme to the other, is a function of
the increase in atomic weight and is not sudden but <em class="italic">gradual</em>.
And so the basic function, the tendency to produce the hydroxide-ion,
is found to grow <em class="italic">weaker</em> as one goes from sodium to magnesium
and then to aluminium, hydroxide; and the acid function,
the tendency to produce the hydrogen-ion, grows markedly stronger,
as one goes from phosphoric to sulphuric and perchloric acids. It
is not surprising to find the two functions existing together, <em class="italic">but in
rather weak form, in the case of the intermediate hydroxides</em>, notably
in aluminium hydroxide and, to some degree, in silicic acid, <em class="italic">the
acid character beginning before the basic function has ceased</em>. In
accordance with this view, aluminium hydroxide is found to be
only a <em class="italic">weak</em>, slightly ionized base, and a <em class="italic">very weak</em>, even less readily
ionizable acid. In the case of silicic acid, which is the next hydroxide
one meets as one goes toward the acid end of the series,
the conditions are reversed. As the name indicates, it is primarily
an acid, but it is a very weak one, and a critical scrutiny of its
behavior shows it to have <em class="italic">very weak basic</em> functions, much weaker
than those of aluminium hydroxide. The question may, indeed,
be raised, whether either the basic or the acid properties really
die out altogether in the hydroxides, from one end of the series
to the other. In view of the small tendency toward sudden
changes found in nature, one might suspect traces of basic character
to be preserved right through the series to the strongest acids,
like perchloric acid. As a matter of fact, later (see Chapter
XV), we shall be obliged to consider possible basic functions of
the strongest oxygen acids, such as nitric, perchloric, permanganic
acids, and one of their most important properties, their behavior
as oxidizing agents, will be found to be probably intimately associated
with this remnant of basic ionization. On the other
hand, fused sodium hydroxide will dissolve sodium with evolution
of hydrogen, sodium oxide, Na─O─Na, being formed; and it can
readily be shown,<a id="FNanchor_356_379" href="#Footnote_356_379" class="fnanchor">356</a> that in the fused hydroxide there must be at
least a few ions NaO<sup>−</sup>, besides HO<sup>−</sup>, H<sup>+</sup>, O<sup>2−</sup>, and
Na<sup>+</sup>. <a id="p174" class="xxpn">[p174]</a></p>

<p>The position of aluminium in the periodic system adequately
accounts, then, for the amphoteric character of its hydroxide.<a id="FNanchor_357_380" href="#Footnote_357_380" class="fnanchor">357</a></p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Common Occurrence of Amphoteric Hydroxides.</h4>—If we
consider the question of amphoteric behavior a little longer—its
consequences are used extensively in analytical work—we
find, in the periodic system, two other regular changes
concerning acid and basic functions, only one of which we shall
discuss here.<a id="FNanchor_358_381" href="#Footnote_358_381" class="fnanchor">358</a> While in a <em class="italic">series</em> of elements the acid character
of the hydroxides increases with the atomic weight, in a family
of elements the reverse relation holds. From nitrogen to bismuth,
in the nitrogen family of the sixth column of the periodic system,
the acid character of the hydroxides grows steadily weaker, the
basic character increases, and we find, again, that the intermediate
elements, notably arsenic and antimony, produce hydroxides, which
show markedly amphoteric character.</div>

<p>If, in the second series of the periodic group, one goes back
from aluminium to magnesium hydroxide, in accordance with the
first general principle laid down a much stronger base is found;
and if one then goes, in the magnesium family, to the hydroxide
of the element of next lower atomic weight, glucinum or beryllium,
one again meets, in accordance with the second principle laid
down, a weaker basic and more acidic hydroxide than magnesium
hydroxide; in other words, the basic and acid functions revert closely
to those exhibited by aluminium hydroxide. Glucinum hydroxide
is a pronounced amphoteric hydroxide and resembles aluminium
hydroxide so closely that, in the early history of chemistry, it was
mistaken for the latter.</p>

<p>If one goes from glucinum back to lithium, in the same series of
the periodic system, and from lithium to the element with the
next lower atomic weight in the same group, one comes to hydrogen,
which forms one of the most important and interesting of the
<a id="p175" class="xxpn">[p175]</a> amphoteric hydroxides, water. The ionization of water, slight as
it is, yields hydrogen-ion and hydroxide-ion, the ions characteristic
of acids and of bases, and water is placed among the weakest
of the acids (see table, p. <a href="#p104">104</a>) as well as among the weakest of
the bases (table, p. <a href="#p106">106</a>). We shall return to these relations,
presently, and shall find that the apparent weakness of water, as
a base and as an acid, is seemingly very largely due to the fact
that water represents only an extremely dilute solution (see p.
<a href="#p066">66</a>) of the real hydroxide, HOH, or hydrol, and consists very
largely of a compound (H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>. H<sub>2</sub>O, or hydrol, is, perhaps, not
very much weaker as an acid or as a base, than is aluminium
hydroxide.</p>

<p>Lower oxides of elements in the higher (acid-forming) groups
show a less pronounced acid-forming character than the higher
oxides, and a greater tendency to produce bases as well as
acids, and are often amphoteric. Chromium hydroxide is of
this type.</p>

<p>In view of all these facts, and in view, also, of the fact that
the majority of the seventy-odd elements cannot lie at the ends
of the periodic system but are found in the middle, it is not surprising
to find that <em class="italic">pronounced amphoterism is shown by a large
number of metal hydroxides; it is, perhaps, the rule rather than the
exception</em>. A considerable number of the elements in the middle of
the system are rare elements and that is perhaps the chief reason
why this relation does not stand out more prominently in the
consideration of the common acids and bases.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Amphoteric Character of Hydroxides Considered in Analysis.</h4>—The
amphoteric character of hydroxides is frequently made
use of in analytical work in the separation and identification of
various elements and, when present, it must always be considered,
in order to escape possible error. The following hydroxides of the
common elements show <em class="italic">pronounced amphoteric</em> character: aluminium,
chromic, zinc, lead, stannous, antimonous hydroxides and
arsenious, platinic, auric, antimonic and stannic acids. Arsenic
acid, ferric hydroxide and silicic acid show exceedingly slight, but
perceptible, amphoteric character, sufficient to affect, to a certain
degree, their analytical behavior.<a id="FNanchor_359_382" href="#Footnote_359_382" class="fnanchor">359</a> <a id="p176" class="xxpn">[p176]</a></div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Self-Neutralization of Amphoteric Substances.</h4><a id="FNanchor_360_383" href="#Footnote_360_383" class="fnanchor">360</a>—We may
turn now to the third question raised in connection with aluminium
hydroxide, to the inquiry (p. <a href="#p171">171</a>), why aluminium hydroxide, the
acid, does not neutralize aluminium hydroxide, the base. In
fact, the base must and does form a salt with the acid. But the
salt is formed only to a minimal extent, as the result of the fact
that the base is a very weak base, the acid an exceedingly weak
acid. Such exceedingly weak bases and acids show little tendency
to combine with each other to form salts <em class="italic">in the presence of water,
especially if one or both are difficultly soluble in water</em>, as in the
present instance. The behavior of aluminium hydroxide, in this
respect, is part of a much larger and more general question, growing
out of the fact that water is a very weak acid and base, as has been
seen, and, to a greater or lesser extent, reacts as such with salts,
which are dissolved in it. This action of water plays an important
rôle in many analytical reactions, and especially, also, in the reactions
of aluminium salts. We shall, first, discuss this larger question
of the action of water, as an ionogen, on salts, and then return
(p. <a href="#p187">187</a>) to the problem of the self-neutralization of an amphoteric
hydroxide.</div>


<h4 class="block">Hydrolysis of Salts</h4>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Ionization of Water.</h4>—We may first consider, very briefly,
the evidence that water is ionized even to the extent indicated by
the ionization constants given in our tables. It may be said that
the purest water ever prepared<a id="FNanchor_361_384" href="#Footnote_361_384" class="fnanchor">361</a> shows a minimal conductivity,
from which the concentrations of its hydrogen and hydroxide ions
and the value of the ionization constant may be calculated. For
the ionization of water we have</div>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
[H<sup>+</sup>] × [HO<sup>−</sup>] / [Nonionized water] = K<sub>Ion</sub>.
</div></div>

<p>As the concentration of pure water, or of the water in dilute
solutions, may be considered nearly a constant, we may put</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
[H<sup>+</sup>] × [HO<sup>−</sup>] = K<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub>.
</div></div>

<p>This is the relation most commonly, and most conveniently,
used. It is free from all assumptions as to the molecular weight
of the nonionized water, the calculation of the concentrations
<a id="p177" class="xxpn">[p177]</a> [H<sup>+</sup>] and [OH<sup>−</sup>] being independent of any such assumption. The
value of K<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> increases decidedly with an increase in the temperature,<a id="FNanchor_362_385" href="#Footnote_362_385" class="fnanchor">362</a>
whereas the ionization constant of an ordinary acid, such
as acetic acid, is affected very little by changes in temperature.
This peculiar increase of the ionization of water at higher temperatures
is undoubtedly due to the increasing dissociation of the
complex water molecules into hydrol molecules (see p. <a href="#p066">66</a>), which,
presumably, are most easily ionized. Now, the value of the constant
K<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub>, at any temperature, may be determined in some half
a dozen different and independent ways, including the conductivity
method mentioned, and one of the most remarkable developments
of the theory of ionization is that all of these methods lead to concordant
results.<a id="FNanchor_363_386" href="#Footnote_363_386" class="fnanchor">363</a></p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p>Aside from considerations based on its ionization, water may be shown, by its
chemical behavior, to have the functions of an acid and of a base, and the conclusions
reached are in complete accord with those reached with the aid of
the theory of ionization.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Water is An Acid.</h4>—If the oxide of a metal such as copper, lead or calcium,
is treated with an acid, a salt is formed by the combination of the two; for
instance, we have</div>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
<span class="ibnowrap">
PbO + HCl → Pb(OH)Cl,
<br />
Pb(OH)Cl + HCl → PbCl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O,

PbO + 2 HCl → PbCl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O,
<br />
CaO + 2 HCl → CaCl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O.
</span></div></div>

<p class="continue">Water will combine with a number of oxides very much in the same manner
and sometimes with such vigor, that considerable heat is evolved, as in the
slaking of lime (<em class="italic">exp.</em>):</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
CaO + HOH → Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>.
</div></div>

<p class="continue">Water in this, and similar actions, takes the place of and plays the rôle of, an
<em class="italic">acid</em>, and <em class="italic">the metal hydroxides or bases appear as its salts</em>.<a id="FNanchor_364_387" href="#Footnote_364_387" class="fnanchor">364</a> It is a <em class="italic">very weak</em>
acid, which can easily be driven out of its salts by any stronger acid (neutralization
of bases), but that does not alter the conclusions reached. Considered
from the point of view of the theory of ionization, the relation
<a id="p178" class="xxpn">[p178]</a> would be expressed by saying that in the common bases the positive hydrogen
ion of water has been replaced by some other positive or metal ion. The
salt of any acid could be defined in exactly the same way.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Water as a Base.</h4>—Acid oxides, such as carbon dioxide, silicon dioxide,
arsenious oxide, combine more or less readily with bases, such as sodium
hydroxide, to form salts:</div>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
<span class="ibnowrap">
CO<sub>2</sub> + NaOH → NaHCO<sub>3</sub>,
<br />
As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 2 NaOH → 2 NaAsO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O.
</span></div></div>

<p class="continue">A number of acid oxides combine with water in exactly the same manner,
and sometimes with such tremendous vigor, that great care must be taken in
bringing the two together, as is the case when sulphur trioxide or phosphorus
pentoxide are added to water (<em class="italic">Exp.</em>).</p>

<div class="chemathbox">
<div id="p178float">We have</div>
<div class="equation">
P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> + HOH → 2 HPO<sub>3</sub>.
</div></div>

<p class="continue">It is evident that in such actions water may take the place of, and play the rôle
of, an ordinary base, forming the <em class="italic">acids</em>, which may well be defined as hydrogen
salts.<a id="FNanchor_365_388" href="#Footnote_365_388" class="fnanchor">365</a> It is true that the basic properties of water are so weak, that the metal
ion of even a weak base, like ammonium hydroxide, will replace the hydrogen-ion
in its salts, the acids, quite readily (HCl + NH<sub>4</sub>OH ⥂ NH<sub>4</sub>Cl + H<sub>2</sub>O).
But such a weak base, in turn, will have to give way, of course, to still
stronger bases; for instances, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl + NaOH ⥂ NaCl + NH<sub>4</sub>OH. From
the point of view of the theory of ionization, the hydrogen-ion is positive, like
all the other metals ions whose hydroxides are bases.</p>

<p>There should be no difficulty, therefore, in considering water to have the
chemical properties of a base as well as of an acid. Its chemical activities
as such, weak as they may be, must be satisfied whenever it is present. These
activities lead to the hydrolysis or the decomposition of salts by water, in
greater or lesser degree, whenever water is used as a solvent for salts.</p></div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Action of Water on a Salt of a Strong Base and a Strong Acid.</h4>—If
sodium chloride, a typical salt formed from a strong base and a
strong acid, is dissolved in water, it is ionized to a considerable extent.
Considering the solution from a mechanical point of view, we
would expect that the sodium ions, moving in all directions, would
collide occasionally with hydroxide ions, which are formed from
the water and are present in minute but definite quantity. Some
of the collisions must result in the formation of sodium hydroxide,
as we have no reason to suppose that the result would differ from
that in other cases where positively charged particles meet with
negatively charged ones. However, since sodium hydroxide is an
ionogen, with a very great tendency to ionize, and since there is
present only a minute concentration of the hydroxide-ion, the
<a id="p179" class="xxpn">[p179]</a> equilibrium conditions will be satisfied when only traces of the nonionized
hydroxide are formed. In a similar manner, we must
expect to have traces, and only traces, of nondissociated hydrochloric
acid formed by the union of chloride ions with some of the
hydrogen ions of the water. Since hydrogen chloride and sodium
hydroxide show practically the same tendency to ionize (tables,
pp. <a href="#p104">104</a> and <a href="#p106">106</a>), the two kinds of ions which water forms, the
hydrogen-ion and the hydroxide-ion, will be used up <em class="italic">to a very
slight</em> and practically <em class="italic">equal</em> extent to form nonionized sodium
hydroxide and hydrogen chloride, but the ions will be immediately
regenerated, and in equal concentrations, from the nonionized
water which is present. All the equilibrium requirements
will be satisfied when <em class="italic">traces</em> of sodium chloride have been converted
into nonionized sodium hydroxide and hydrogen chloride.
Such a solution, containing no excess of the hydrogen-&#160;or the
hydroxide-ion, would react <em class="italic">neutral</em>. The action may be expressed
by the equation<a id="FNanchor_366_389" href="#Footnote_366_389" class="fnanchor">366</a></div>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">

<br />
Na<sup>+</sup> + HO<sup>−</sup> ⇄ NaOH
<br />
Cl<sup>−</sup> + H<sup>+</sup> ⇄ HCl.
</span></div></div>

<p>The decomposition of sodium chloride by water, which one may
predict on the basis of these theoretical considerations, may be
demonstrated, slight as it is, by the following experiment.<a id="FNanchor_367_390" href="#Footnote_367_390" class="fnanchor">367</a></p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p><em class="smcap">Exp.</em> A pinch of sodium chloride is brought into a platinum crucible,
which is previously heated in a blast lamp to a bright yellow heat (1100°);
then 1 c.c. of water is introduced, drop by drop. A steam cushion is formed
at once (Leidenfrost's phenomenon). After about half of the water has been
evaporated (half a minute), the water is poured into a solution colored with
blue litmus; it is changed to red by an excess of hydrochloric acid in the
water. The crucible is cooled, and the salt remaining in it is dissolved in a
little water and the solution poured into a red litmus solution; the latter
turns blue.</p></div>

<p>The sodium chloride has obviously been partially decomposed, by
the water, into its base and its acid; the decomposition is favored
by the high temperature and by the fact that the hydrogen chloride
<a id="p180" class="xxpn">[p180]</a> formed can pass through the steam cushion into the water, while
the sodium hydroxide is left behind. The removal of a product
of the decomposition would favor its progress (see. p. <a href="#p114">114</a>).</p>

<p>The conclusions concerning salts of the type of sodium chloride
may then be summarized in the statement, that <em class="italic">salts formed by
the union of a very strong base with an equally strong acid are only
very slightly decomposed by water and their solutions show a neutral
reaction</em>.</p>

<p>The decomposition of a salt by water into its component base

<p class="continue">When the cyanide is dissolved in water, we must obtain, for the
same reasons as were developed in the discussion of the hydrolysis
of sodium chloride, a <em class="italic">little</em> nonionized potassium hydroxide, from
the union of potassium ions with hydroxide ions, formed by the
water. Potassium hydroxide being a strong, easily ionizable base,
there will be only a <em class="italic">slight tendency</em> towards this union. Hydrocyanic
acid, on the other hand, is an exceedingly weak acid. The
value of its ionization constant K<sub>HCN</sub> = [H<sup>+</sup>] × [CN<sup>−</sup>] / [HCN] is
only 7E−10, as compared with a similar ratio approximating
1 for potassium hydroxide ([K<sup>+</sup>] × [HO<sup>−</sup>] / [KOH] = 1; see the
tables, p. <a href="#p104">104</a> and p. <a href="#p106">106</a> and see pp. <a href="#p106">106</a>–7). The hydrogen-ion,
formed from the water, must therefore combine with cyanide-ion,
<em class="italic">to form nonionized hydrocyanic acid</em>, much more completely than
the hydroxide-ion combines with potassium-ion. With the disappearance
of the ions of water, in this case notably of its hydrogen
ions, more water must ionize to satisfy the ionization constant
<a id="p181" class="xxpn">[p181]</a> for water (p. <a href="#p176">176</a>), and the formation of hydrocyanic acid will continue,
towards the satisfying of its own constant. It is important
to note that, for the reasons given, the hydrogen-ion of water <em class="italic">is used
up to a far greater extent</em> than is the hydroxide-ion; <em class="italic">the latter therefore
accumulates</em>, and this accumulation results in the formation
of smaller and smaller concentrations of the hydrogen-ion, by the
water. Since [H<sup>+</sup>] × [HO<sup>−</sup>] = 1.2E−14 (at 25°; p. <a href="#p104">104</a>), as [HO<sup>−</sup>]
grows larger, [H<sup>+</sup>] must grow <em class="italic">proportionally smaller</em>. The <em class="italic">suppression
of the hydrogen-ion by the accumulation of the hydroxide ion</em>
will, ultimately, make [H<sup>+</sup>] so small, that the equilibrium ratio
[H<sup>+</sup>] × [CN<sup>−</sup>] / [HCN] will equal the equilibrium constant. Since
the union of the hydrogen-ion with the cyanide-ion, to form little
ionized hydrocyanic acid, is the main moving cause for the
changes, the latter will then come to a standstill and equilibrium
will be established. The net result of the action of water on
potassium cyanide may be said to consist in the formation of practically
nonionized hydrocyanic acid and the liberation of (chiefly)
ionized potassium hydroxide, <em class="italic">until all the equilibrium constants</em> of the
system are satisfied. We note that potassium cyanide solution
must react strongly alkaline (<em class="italic">exp.</em>) and that a free acid (<em class="italic">e.g.</em> HCN)
may well exist in the presence of a free base (<em class="italic">e.g.</em> KOH), provided
the acid is present in a nonionized, and therefore chemically inactive,
condition (inactive as an <em class="italic">acid</em>).</p>

<p>Ignoring the (practically) unimportant formation of small quantities
of nonionized potassium hydroxide, we may summarize the
action in a single equation, which shows the main action:</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
CN<sup>−</sup> + HOH ⇄ HCN + HO<sup>−</sup>.
</div></div>

<p>Whereas water, as an acid and as a base, is so exceedingly weak,
that it can form but traces of its own salts, sodium hydroxide and
hydrochloric acid, when acting on sodium chloride and competing
for the base with such a strong acid as hydrochloric acid and for
the acid with such a strong base as sodium hydroxide (see p. <a href="#p179">179</a>),
the result, evidently, is quite different when water competes for a
base with so weak an acid as hydrocyanic acid. In this case, we note
that a considerable quantity of (ionized) potassium hydroxide, the
salt of water in its rôle of an acid, is formed as a result of the
action of water on potassium cyanide. <a id="p182" class="xxpn">[p182]</a></p>

<p>The theory of ionization, with the aid of the law of chemical equilibrium,

<p class="continue">The symbols [H<sup>+</sup>], [CN<sup>−</sup>] and [HCN] denote the final concentrations for the

acid in water. [CN<sup>−</sup>], representing the total concentration of the cyanide-ion,
is very much larger than [H<sup>+</sup>], since the salt, potassium cyanide, produces
the cyanide-ion in large concentrations.</p>

<p>For water, we have [H<sup>+</sup>] × [HO<sup>−</sup>] = K<sub>HOH</sub> = 1.2E−14, at 25°. Here,
again, the symbols represent the final, total concentrations of the ions in the

<p>The cyanide-ion, whose concentration is expressed by [CN<sup>−</sup>], is formed practically
altogether by the ionization of potassium cyanide, which is an easily
ionizable and almost entirely ionized salt; the hydroxide-ion, whose concentration
is expressed by [HO<sup>−</sup>], is formed by the ionization of potassium hydroxide,
which is an easily ionizable base, ionized to practically the same degree as
is the potassium cyanide in the solution. If we represent the <em class="italic">total</em> concentration
of the potassium cyanide, ionized and nonionized, at the point of
equilibrium, by [KCN] and its degree of ionization by α<sub>1</sub>, and if we represent,
similarly, the total concentration of potassium hydroxide by [KOH] and its
degree of ionization by α<sub>2</sub>, the equilibrium equation may be written:</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">

<p>The mathematical equations give us a measure of the extent to which
water must decompose or <em class="italic">hydrolyze</em> the salt in question, as expressed in the
chemical equations (p. <a href="#p180">180</a>). The <em class="italic">extent</em> of the hydrolysis, clearly, depends on
the relative ionization constants of hydrocyanic acid and water, the <em class="italic">two acids
competing for the base</em>.</p>

<p>From the known values of the constants, one may calculate
that, at 25°, in a solution of 6.5 grams potassium cyanide in
a liter (0.1 molar), almost 1.3% of the cyanide is decomposed
into potassium hydroxide and hydrocyanic acid. Since every
molecule of hydrolyzed salt forms one molecule of <a id="p183"
class="xxpn">[p183]</a> the hydroxide and one molecule of the
acid, we may put [KOH] = [HCN] = <em class="italic">x</em>
and [KCN] = 0.1 − <em class="italic">x</em>. The ionization
constant, K<sub>HCN</sub> = 7E−10, and K<sub>HOH</sub> = 1.2E−14,
at 25°. Inserting these values into the equation
[KCN] / ([HCN] × [KOH]) = K<sub>HCN</sub> / K<sub>HOH</sub>
we have: (0.1 − <em class="italic">x</em>) / <em
class="italic">x</em><sup>2</sup> = 7E−10 / 1.2E−14. Here <em
class="italic">x</em> = 0.0013. This is 1.3% of the 0.1 mole of
cyanide used.</p>

<p>One may convince himself, as follows, that the constants are satisfied
when the decomposition of the cyanide has proceeded to this point: the
degrees of ionization of the potassium cyanide and potassium hydroxide, α<sub>1</sub>
and α<sub>2</sub>, may be taken as 85% (the same as the degree of ionization of the
similar electrolyte KCl in 0.1 molar solution). Then [HO<sup>−</sup>] = 0.85 × 0.0013 = 0.0011;
[CN<sup>−</sup>] = 0.85 × (0.1 − 0.0013) = 0.083; [H<sup>+</sup>] = 1.2E−14 / [HO<sup>−</sup>] = 1.1E−11.
For [H<sup>+</sup>] × [CN<sup>−</sup>] / [HCN] we have then:
1.1E−11 × 0.083 / (0.0013)
or 7E−10, the value for the ionization constant of hydrocyanic
acid. It should be noted that, whereas in pure water at 25°
[H<sup>+</sup>] = [HO<sup>−</sup>] = √(1.2E−14) = 1.1E−7, in the solution under consideration [HO<sup>−</sup>]
has increased to the value 0.0011 and [H<sup>+</sup>] is only 1.1E−11.</p>

<p>The relation developed for the <em class="italic">hydrolysis</em> of potassium cyanide is a general
one, holding for the hydrolysis of salts, of the type MeX, of a weak acid with
a strong base. It may be expressed in general as follows: for the hydrolysis
of a salt according to MeX + HOH ⇄ MeOH + HX, where HX is a weak
acid and MEOH a strong base, we have:<a id="FNanchor_369_392" href="#Footnote_369_392" class="fnanchor">369</a></p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
[Salt] / ([Acid] × [Base]) = K<sub>Acid</sub> / K<sub>HOH</sub>.
</div></div>

<p>It is clear, from the equation, that the weaker the acid of the salt (measured
by the ionization constant K<sub>Acid</sub>, the numerator on the right), the more will
water, <em class="italic">ceteris paribus</em>, be able to drive it out of its salt and form its own salt,
<em class="italic">the base</em> (the smaller the numerator on the right, the larger must be the denominator
on the left).</p></div>

<p>The conclusions may be summarized in the statement that
the salts of strong bases with weak acids are more or less
decomposed by water (hydrolyzed) and the resulting solutions
must react <em class="italic">alkaline</em>. We find, as a matter of fact, that aqueous
solutions of potassium cyanide, sodium carbonate, sodium sulphide,
borax (see the table, p. <a href="#p104">104</a>), all react strongly alkaline to
litmus (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). Conversely, it may be said, that if the sodium or
potassium salt of an acid dissolves in water with a <em class="italic">decidedly</em> alkaline
reaction, it is the salt of a weak, poorly ionized acid.<a id="FNanchor_370_393" href="#Footnote_370_393" class="fnanchor">370</a> <a id="p184" class="xxpn">[p184]</a></p>

about the same as in pure water, and the formation of nonionized

can be formulated with the aid of the theory of ionization

<p>For the cyanide of a base, which is as weak a base as hydrocyanic
acid is an acid, we find that the decomposition by water, at
25° in a 0.1 molar solution, must comprise 99.35%<a id="FNanchor_375_398" href="#Footnote_375_398" class="fnanchor">375</a> of the salt, in
order to establish equilibrium. In the case of potassium cyanide,
in 0.1 molar solution, only 1.3% of the salt is decomposed (p. <a href="#p182">182</a>).</p>

<p>Now, if both the free base and the free acid are very <em class="italic">difficultly
soluble</em>, then the concentrations [MeOH] and [HX], respectively, in
the solution <em class="italic">cannot go beyond a certain minute limit</em>. In view,<a id="FNanchor_376_399" href="#Footnote_376_399" class="fnanchor">376</a> then,
of the very small value, K<sub>Base</sub>, of the ratio [Me<sup>+</sup>] × [HO<sup>−</sup>] / [MeOH]
and the minute value that the second term [MeOH] has under
these conditions, the first term [Me<sup>+</sup>] × [HO<sup>−</sup>] must have a correspondingly
smaller value. It is clear, therefore, that in such
a solution neither the nonionized base, MeOH, nor its ion, Me<sup>+</sup>,
can exist in more than minute quantities when the equilibrium constants
are satisfied. The same conclusion is reached regarding the
<a id="p186" class="xxpn">[p186]</a> possibility of the existence of the difficultly soluble acid HX and
its ion X<sup>−</sup>, in more than minimal quantities. Since, then, neither
the ion Me<sup>+</sup> nor the ion X<sup>−</sup> can be present in more than traces,
their salt, MeX, which is considered readily ionizable, also <em class="italic">cannot
exist in aqueous solutions</em>, except in traces.</p>

It is evident that the concentration of the salt, [Salt], which is
capable of existence in aqueous solution, is, in the first place,
<em class="italic">the smaller the smaller the values</em> for
K<sub>Acid</sub> and K<sub>Base</sub> are, <em class="italic">i.e.

the aluminate, like other aluminates, is presumably readily ionizable in aqueous

would satisfy the equilibrium constant for water (p. <a href="#p176">176</a>); the excess of these
ions must combine to form water, until the product of their concentrations is
equal to the ionization constant of water. The neutralization of these first
quantities of hydrogen and hydroxide ions would destroy the momentary
condition of equilibrium between aluminium hydroxide and its ions and would
lead to its further ionization, <em class="italic">both as a base and as an acid</em>, and to the solution
of some aluminium hydroxide (see the above equilibrium equations). However,
since AlO<sup>+</sup> and AlO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> remain practically uncombined and therefore <em class="italic">accumulate</em>
in the solution, the concentrations of the hydroxide and hydrogen ions
formed grow smaller and smaller; for an increasing excess of the ion AlO<sup>+</sup>

equation for K<sub>Base</sub>, and, similarly, an increasing excess of the ion
AlO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> will permit [H<sup>+</sup>] to reach only smaller and smaller values, according to
the equilibrium equation for K<sub>Acid</sub>. When the values for [HO<sup>−</sup>] and [H<sup>+</sup>]
have in this way become small enough to make [HO<sup>−</sup>] × [H<sup>+</sup>] = K<sub>HOH</sub>,
equilibrium is reached. It is evident that in such a solution, in the condition

<p>It is clear, that the smaller the ionization constants K<sub>Base</sub> and K<sub>Acid</sub> are,
and the smaller the solubility of nonionized aluminium hydroxide [Alum.
Hydroxide] is, the smaller must be the concentration of the aluminate formed
to satisfy the conditions for equilibrium.</p>

<p>Aluminium hydroxide is a typical <em class="italic">amphoteric
hydroxide</em>, and the relations developed may be applied,
<em class="italic">mutatis mutandis</em>, to the conditions
of equilibrium for analogous amphoteric hydroxides, such as
zinc, lead, chromic hydroxides, and so forth. Salt formation
or self-neutralization will depend, in every instance, on the
strength of the base and the acid formed, and on the solubility of
the hydroxide.<a id="FNanchor_380_403" href="#Footnote_380_403"

<p>With the aid of the preceding considerations the analytical
reactions of aluminium, which are used to separate it from other
elements and to identify it, may be readily understood. They will
be discussed in connection with the analysis of the "Aluminium
and Zinc Groups."</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Analysis of the Aluminium and Zinc Groups.</h4>—The
groups of metals which are here called the
<a id="p189" class="xxpn">[p189]</a> "<em class="italic">Aluminium and Zinc Groups</em>" consist of two groups,
which ordinarily are precipitated
together in qualitative analysis, and which are then separated
from each other. We may distinguish the "<em class="italic">Aluminium Group</em>"
of trivalent metal ions, including aluminium, ferric and chromium
ions, and the "<em class="italic">Zinc Group</em>" of bivalent metal ions, including
zinc, nickelous, cobaltous, manganous and ferrous ions. Of the
two groups, the ions of the second group, in agreement with their
lower valence (see p. <a href="#p172">172</a>), form the <em class="italic">stronger bases</em>, and, as such,
they are all capable of forming <em class="italic">comparatively stable salts</em> even with
such very weak acids as hydrogen sulphide and carbonic acid. Ammonium
sulphide, added to a solution of a salt of any one of the
ions of the zinc group, precipitates the corresponding sulphide,
sodium or ammonium carbonate precipitates the corresponding
carbonate.<a id="FNanchor_381_404" href="#Footnote_381_404" class="fnanchor">381</a> We have, for instance:</div>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
<span class="ibnowrap">
FeCl<sub>2</sub> + (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S → FeS ↓ + 2 NH<sub>4</sub>Cl,
<br />
FeCl<sub>2</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> → FeCO<sub>3</sub> ↓ + 2 NaCl.
</span></div></div>

<p class="continue">Only one member of this group, zinc, forms an <em class="italic">amphoteric</em> hydroxide
and advantage is taken of this in identifying zinc.</p>

<p>The members of the aluminium group form hydroxides, which are
much weaker bases than are the hydroxides of the bivalent group just
considered. Their salts with strong acids are considerably hydrolyzed
and react strongly acid, and their salts with very weak acids, like
carbonic acid and hydrogen sulphide, are decomposed so readily by
water, that only ferric sulphide is capable of existence in its
presence. When the sulphide, Al<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, prepared
by heating aluminium with sulphur, is added to water, it is totally
decomposed into the hydroxide and hydrogen sulphide (p. <a href="#p186">186</a>); and
<em class="italic">if aluminium chloride is treated with ammonium
sulphide</em> in aqueous solution, <em class="italic">aluminium
hydroxide, and not its sulphide, is precipitated</em>. The latter
result may be interpreted in two ways, both of which, in the
ultimate analysis, mean that hydrogen sulphide is too weak an acid
to form a stable sulphide with aluminium hydroxide in the presence
of water, the difficult solubility of aluminium hydroxide and the
limited solubility of hydrogen sulphide being favoring factors
(see p. <a href="#p186">186</a>). In a solution of aluminium chloride, the salt of a
very weak base with a strong <a id="p190" class="xxpn">[p190]</a>
acid, more or less of the salt is hydrolyzed, and we have a
condition of equilibrium as expressed in the equation <span
class="ibnowrap">AlCl<sub>3</sub> + 3 H<sub>2</sub>O ⇄</span> <span
class="ibnowrap">Al(OH)<sub>3</sub> + 3 HCl.</span> The addition
of ammonium sulphide to such a solution would neutralize the free
hydrochloric acid, and the action would proceed to completion
towards the right, hydrogen sulphide being liberated, by the action
of the acid on the ammonium sulphide. As hydrogen sulphide is too
weak an acid to combine, appreciably, with aluminium hydroxide,
and as the latter is difficultly soluble, the hydroxide is
precipitated. According to the degree of dilution, more or less of
the hydrogen sulphide also escapes. Besides this interpretation of
the precipitation of aluminium hydroxide under these conditions, we
may also consider the following: any aluminium sulphide, formed the
first moment, would remain largely ionized and would be immediately
converted, by the ions of water, into aluminium hydroxide and
hydrogen sulphide. The net result of the action is the precipitation
of aluminium hydroxide and the evolution of hydrogen sulphide:</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
<span class="ibnowrap">
2 AlCl<sub>3</sub> + 3 (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S + 6 H<sub>2</sub>O →

<br />
2 Al<sup>3+</sup> + 3 S<sup>2−</sup> + 6 HOH → 2 Al(OH)<sub>3</sub> ↓ + 3 H<sub>2</sub>S ↑.
</span></div></div>

<p>A similar result is obtained when the solution of a chromium
salt is treated with a solution of ammonium sulphide. Only ferric
hydroxide is capable of forming a sulphide, ferric sulphide, Fe<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>,
which is precipitated when solutions of ferric salts are treated with
ammonium sulphide.<a id="FNanchor_382_405" href="#Footnote_382_405" class="fnanchor">382</a></p>

<p>Ammonium sulphide will, consequently, precipitate aluminium
and chromium <em class="italic">hydroxides</em> and ferric, ferrous, nickel, cobalt, manganese
and zinc <em class="italic">sulphides</em>, from a solution of the chlorides of
the metals.</p>

<p>Now, both the sulphides and the hydroxides of the alkaline
earths and alkalies are sufficiently soluble not to be precipitated
by ammonium sulphide, or by a mixture of it with ammonium
hydroxide, if ammonium chloride be added to the mixture to
prevent the precipitation of magnesium hydroxide (see p. <a href="#p168">168</a>),
which is the least soluble of the hydroxides of the alkaline earth
group. <a id="p191" class="xxpn">[p191]</a> <em class="italic">A mixture of ammonium sulphide, ammonium hydroxide
and ammonium chloride will, therefore, precipitate the aluminium
and zinc groups together, separating them from the alkaline earth and
alkali groups.</em><a id="FNanchor_383_406" href="#Footnote_383_406" class="fnanchor">383</a></p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Separation of the Aluminium Group from the Zinc Group by
Means of Ammonium Chloride and Ammonium Hydroxide.</h4>—The
precipitation of the two groups together makes their subsequent
separation necessary. Some analysts attempt to avoid the
extra operations involved, by making use of the fact that the
hydroxides of the bivalent group, although difficultly soluble,
are, like magnesium hydroxide, still sufficiently soluble not to be
precipitated by ammonium hydroxide in the presence of sufficient
ammonium chloride, while the hydroxides of the trivalent metals
of this group are so insoluble that they may be precipitated quantitatively
by such a mixture (p. <a href="#p170">170</a>). The trivalent hydroxides
may be first precipitated by ammonium hydroxide, in the presence
of ammonium chloride, and, subsequently, the sulphides of the
bivalent metals may be precipitated by ammonium sulphide, the
two precipitates being collected separately. The method has the
disadvantage that it is not always accurate. The acid character
of aluminium and chromium hydroxides (and even of ferric hydroxide,
see p. <a href="#p195">195</a>), as well as of zinc hydroxide, leads, to a
certain extent, to the precipitation, from such <em class="italic">alkaline</em> solutions,
of <em class="italic">salts</em> of these amphoteric hydroxides with the basic hydroxides
of the bivalent group; the latter are thus liable to be <em class="italic">lost</em> in the
analysis. It will be recalled, that the equilibrium conditions in
alkaline solutions <em class="italic">favor</em> the <em class="italic">ionization</em> of amphoteric substances
in the acid form (Part III), and <em class="italic">alkaline</em> solutions would favor the
precipitation of aluminates, chromites, etc., of the ions of the zinc
group. Methods have, therefore, been devised to separate the
two groups in neutral, or very slightly acid, media, and they give
quantitative separations and are preferable to the method just
described. The separation by means of suspended <em class="italic">barium carbonate</em>,
in which carbonic acid is liberated and the solution is practically
neutral, will be discussed below on page <a href="#p193">193</a>. A second
method, frequently used in quantitative analysis, is based on the
<a id="p192" class="xxpn">[p192]</a> <em class="italic">decomposition</em> of the <em class="italic">acetates</em> of the aluminium group by boiling
water, acetic acid being liberated.<a id="FNanchor_384_407" href="#Footnote_384_407" class="fnanchor">384</a></div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Separation of Cobalt and Nickel from the Other Members
of the Zinc and Aluminium Groups.</h4>—When the aluminium
and zinc groups are precipitated together, by means of a mixture
of ammonium sulphide, hydroxide and chloride, the precipitate,
obtained from a solution containing, say, the chlorides of all the
ions of the groups, would consist of the following compounds:</div>

<p class="mions"><em class="italic">Aluminium Group</em>:
Fe<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>,
Cr(OH)<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p class="mions"><em class="italic">Zinc Group</em>: NiS, CoS,
FeS, MnS,<a id="FNanchor_385_408" href="#Footnote_385_408"
class="fnanchor">385</a> ZnS.</p>

<p>If such a precipitate is treated, in the cold, for a short time
with quite dilute (1 to 1.2 molar) hydrochloric acid, all of the
hydroxides and sulphides dissolve, excepting the greater part of
the nickel and cobalt sulphides, <em class="italic">which dissolve very much more
slowly than do the other compounds</em>. Advantage is taken of this fact,
to separate these two elements from the remaining members of
these groups, and if the treatment is carried out with care, the
separation is usually satisfactory. In all cases, however, since
it is a question of delayed solution only, at least traces, and
sometimes considerably more than traces, of the sulphides of nickel
and cobalt go into solution with the other compounds. No sacrifice
of analytical accuracy is involved, if this possible loss is
kept in mind and provision made for the later detection of these
small quantities of nickel and cobalt.</p>

<p>The question of the slow solution, or apparent lack of solubility,
of nickel and cobalt sulphides in dilute hydrochloric acid has
formed an interesting problem for investigation. While nickel
and cobalt sulphides are precipitated by ammonium sulphide,
these sulphides, in common with those of all the other members of
the zinc group, are not precipitated by hydrogen sulphide in the
presence of a small excess of hydrochloric acid.<a id="FNanchor_386_409" href="#Footnote_386_409" class="fnanchor">386</a> We would have <a id="p193" class="xxpn">[p193]</a></p>

<p class="continue">as representing the condition of equilibrium, if we start with
nickel chloride, hydrochloric acid and hydrogen sulphide; the
amount of sulphide NiS, formed, is insufficient to supersaturate the
solution and form a precipitate. In reversible reactions the final
condition of equilibrium must be independent of the order in
which components are mixed (p. <a href="#p091">91</a>), a conclusion which is borne
out by experience. One should expect, then, that nickel sulphide,
when treated with dilute hydrochloric acid, would dissolve and give
nickel chloride, hydrogen sulphide and an excess of acid, and thus
produce the same system, found to be in equilibrium, when one
starts with the chloride, hydrogen sulphide and hydrochloric acid.
As a matter of fact, the same condition of <em class="italic">equilibrium</em> is <em class="italic">finally</em>
reached, only <em class="italic">it is reached slowly</em>,<a id="FNanchor_387_410" href="#Footnote_387_410" class="fnanchor">387</a> much more slowly than ordinarily
in such cases, much more slowly, for instance, than with
ferrous sulphide, hydrochloric acid and hydrogen sulphide (<em class="italic">exp.</em>).
By taking advantage of this slow return to equilibrium and
by working with the system <em class="italic">during the process of slow change</em>
(collecting the undissolved nickel and cobalt sulphides on a
filter), one can separate the sulphides of nickel and cobalt from
the other components of the mixed precipitate, which dissolve
much more rapidly.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Separation of the Aluminium and Zinc Groups by Means of
Barium Carbonate.</h4>—The solution, obtained by treating the
mixture of the sulphides and hydroxides of the aluminium and
zinc groups with dilute hydrochloric acid (p. <a href="#p192">192</a>), contains aluminium,
chromium, manganous, zinc and ferrous chlorides, all the iron
being now present in the ferrous condition because of the reducing
action of hydrogen sulphide on the ferric-ion (Part III). The
chlorides of nickel and cobalt are also present in small quantities
(see above). The further treatment of the solution is directed
toward a <em class="italic">separation</em> of the <em class="italic">bivalent</em> ions of the zinc group from the
<em class="italic">trivalent</em> ions of the aluminium group, and the intention is to have
all the iron go with the trivalent metals. The ferrous is, therefore,
oxidized to the ferric-ion. After a part of the solution has been
tested to show the presence or absence of ferric salts, the two
groups are separated by means of a suspension, in water, of finely
<a id="p194" class="xxpn">[p194]</a> divided barium carbonate. <em class="italic">The theory of the separation</em> may be
developed as follows:</div>

<p>When zinc chloride, which may be taken as a representative of
the bivalent group, is treated with sodium carbonate, a difficultly
soluble carbonate is precipitated, since zinc hydroxide, like
the remaining bivalent hydroxides, is a sufficiently strong
base to form a fairly stable carbonate.<a id="FNanchor_388_411"
href="#Footnote_388_411" class="fnanchor">388</a> When ferric
chloride, a representative of the trivalent group, is treated
with a solution of sodium carbonate, ferric hydroxide, mixed
with some basic ferric carbonate<a id="FNanchor_389_412"
href="#Footnote_389_412" class="fnanchor">389</a>
Fe<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, is precipitated
and carbon dioxide escapes (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). The
trivalent hydroxides are too weak bases<a id="FNanchor_390_413"
href="#Footnote_390_413" class="fnanchor">390</a> to form stable
salts with so weak an acid as carbonic acid.</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
<span class="ibnowrap">
2 FeCl<sub>3</sub> + 3 Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + 6 H<sub>2</sub>O ⥂

<br />
3 H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> ⇄ 3 H<sub>2</sub>O + 3 CO<sub>2</sub> ↑.
</span></div></div>

<p>Since the bivalent metal ions are precipitated by sodium carbonate
as carbonates and the trivalent ones as hydroxides, the
reagent, obviously, cannot be used to separate the two groups.
But <em class="italic">barium carbonate is so little soluble in water that it will not precipitate
manganous, zinc, nickel, cobalious and ferrous carbonates</em><a id="FNanchor_391_414" href="#Footnote_391_414" class="fnanchor">391</a>
from solutions of their chlorides or nitrates. We have, for instance,
ZnCl<sub>2</sub> + BaCO<sub>3</sub> ↓ ⥃ BaCl<sub>2</sub> + ZnCO<sub>3</sub>. Barium carbonate has, however,
the same effect on ferric chloride (<em class="italic">exp.</em>) and on the other
chlorides of the trivalent group, as has sodium carbonate, <em class="italic">i.e.</em> it
precipitates their <em class="italic">hydroxides</em>. By means of barium carbonate
<a id="p195" class="xxpn">[p195]</a> <em class="italic">we
can, therefore, precipitate the hydroxides of the aluminium group
without precipitating the ions of the zinc group.</em> The separation
is carried out in a, practically, neutral medium (free carbonic acid
in excess is evolved; barium carbonate alone, when treated with
water, is slightly alkaline) and thus avoids the error of facilitating
the precipitation of the bivalent metals in the shape of salts of
the acidic forms of the trivalent metals, i.e. as aluminates, chromites,
and so forth. Manganous salts are liable to oxidation to
manganic salts, when exposed to the air, especially in alkaline,
neutral or <em class="italic">slightly</em> acid solutions, and prolonged exposure of the
barium carbonate mixture to the air may result in the precipitation
of manganic hydroxide, Mn(OH)<sub>3</sub>, with the other trivalent
hydroxides. Provision is made for its detection in the systematic
analysis.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Analysis of the Aluminium Group.</h4>—The precipitate of the
aluminium group may contain aluminium, chromium and ferric
hydroxides (possibly traces of manganic hydroxide) and their
basic carbonates. A color test for ferric-ion has already been
made (see p. <a href="#p193">193</a>) and chromium (and manganese) is readily
found and identified by oxidation to the intensely colored salts of
chromic (and manganic) acid (Part III, <em class="italic">q.v.</em>). In ascertaining
whether aluminium hydroxide is present or not, advantage is
taken of its <em class="italic">amphoteric character</em>. Chromium hydroxide, like
aluminium hydroxide, is amphoteric; but, in agreement with the
greater atomic weight of chromium, it is an even weaker acid
than is aluminium hydroxide. Its sodium salt, sodium chromite,
is completely decomposed by boiling water, chromium hydroxide
being precipitated in a less hydrated, insoluble form. Ferric
hydroxide, whose metal has the highest atomic weight of the
three elements under consideration, has so little acid character,
that it is not perceptibly soluble in solutions of potassium or
sodium hydroxide. (That it has slight acidic properties is shown
by its capacity to form ferrites, <em class="italic">e.g.</em> Me(FeO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, which may best be
obtained by dry methods, and of which ferrous ferrite or magnetic
iron ore, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> or Fe(FeO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, is the most important representative.)
Of the three hydroxides, aluminium hydroxide is,
therefore, the only one that will dissolve in boiling sodium hydroxide.
In this solution we can best identify it, by converting the
aluminate into an aluminium salt, by means of an excess of acid,
<a id="p196" class="xxpn">[p196]</a> and by a final precipitation of aluminium hydroxide with ammonium
hydroxide. Aluminium hydroxide is too weak an acid to
form a stable aluminate with so weak a base as ammonium hydroxide,
when the latter is used only in slight excess (p. <a href="#p186">186</a>). If we
attempt to prepare ammonium aluminate, by adding ammonium
chloride to a solution of sodium aluminate, a precipitate of
aluminium hydroxide is obtained (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). For exact work, an
excess of ammonium hydroxide is to be avoided and <em class="italic">its strength
as a base should be weakened</em> by the addition of some ammonium
chloride or nitrate (pp. <a href="#p114">114</a>, <a href="#p169">169</a>
and Lab. Manual, p. 9, § 6).</div>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p>We have, in this instance, the case of a very weak, difficultly soluble acid,
aluminium hydroxide, forming a salt with a weak, soluble base, ammonium
hydroxide. The conditions determining the <em class="italic">solubility</em> of aluminium hydroxide
in ammonium hydroxide, as an aluminate NH<sub>4</sub>AlO<sub>2</sub>, may be shown as follows:
for the acid ionization of aluminium hydroxide, Al(OH)<sub>3</sub> ⇄ AlO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> +
H<sup>+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O (p. <a href="#p172">172</a>); the solubility-product for a saturated solution is
[AlO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>] × [H<sup>+</sup>] = K<sub>Ac.S.P.</sub>. Further, from [H<sup>+</sup>] × [HO<sup>−</sup>] = K<sub>HOH</sub>, we find
[H<sup>+</sup>] = K<sub>HOH</sub> / [HO<sup>−</sup>]. Then [AlO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>] = [HO<sup>−</sup>] × K<sub>Ac.S.P.</sub> / K<sub>HOH</sub>, which shows
that the solubility of aluminium hydroxide, as aluminate, is proportional to the
concentration [HO<sup>−</sup>] of the hydroxide-ion in the solution. For NH<sub>4</sub>OH we
have [NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>] × [HO<sup>−</sup>] / ([NH<sub>3</sub>] + [NH<sub>4</sub>OH]) = 0.000,018 (p. <a href="#p161">161</a>), and consequently,
[HO<sup>−</sup>] = 0.000,018 × ([NH<sub>3</sub>] + [NH<sub>4</sub>OH]) / [NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>]. Then [HO<sup>−</sup>]
is the smaller, the smaller the excess of ammonium hydroxide used (which is
approximately equal to ([NH<sub>3</sub>] + [NH<sub>4</sub>OH])) and the greater the concentration
[NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>] of the ammonium-ion, <em class="italic">i.e.</em> of the added ammonium salt. The
solubility of Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>, as aluminate, in ammonium hydroxide and ammonium
chloride is, therefore, directly proportional to the excess of ammonium hydroxide,
and indirectly proportional to the concentration of the ammonium salt
present.<a id="FNanchor_392_415" href="#Footnote_392_415" class="fnanchor">392</a></p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Favorable Conditions for a
Maximum Precipitation of an Amphoteric Hydroxide.</h4>—The
precipitation of aluminium hydroxide depends also on the
solubility-product of aluminium hydroxide, ionized as a base.

in a saturated solution,
[Al<sup>3+</sup>] × [HO<sup>−</sup>]<sup>3</sup> = K<sub>Bas.S.P.</sub>.
It is evident, that an excess of the precipitating hydroxide-ion
would be favorable to the precipitation in this form, and that
the reduction of the concentration of the hydroxide-ion, <em

a slightly <em class="italic">alkaline</em> medium—which agrees with common practice. In
other words, there is less danger of losing aluminium hydroxide in
the form of aluminate, owing to the <em class="italic">weaker acid</em> character of the
hydroxide, than there is of losing it in the form of aluminium-ion.
The most favorable degree of alkalinity for the precipitation would
depend on the relation of K<sub>Bas.S.P.</sub>. and K′<sub>Ac.S.P.</sub>.</p>

<p>The exact values for K<sub>Bas.S.P.</sub> and K′<sub>Ac.S.P.</sub>, the two
solubility-product constants, and for the corresponding ionization
constants, which would show the same <em class="italic">ratio</em>, are still not known.
But, if, for the sake of an illustration, we take recourse to
assumed values for these constants, we find that the solubility
of aluminium, as aluminium-ion and as aluminate-ion, is, by
calculation, as anticipated, a <em class="italic">minimum</em> for a solution, which
contains the concentration of HO<sup>−</sup> calculated (for <em class="italic">x</em>) in the
manner indicated above. And the further interesting conclusion is
reached that this minimum loss of aluminium
<a id="p198" class="xxpn">[p198]</a> hydroxide would occur when [Al<sup>3+</sup>] = [AlO<sub>3</sub><sup>3−</sup>]—which would correspond to a
saturated solution of aluminium aluminate, Al(AlO<sub>3</sub>).</p>

<p>When the ionization of aluminium hydroxide, as an acid, is considered
to take place according to Al(OH)<sub>3</sub> ⇄ AlO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> + H<sup>+</sup> +
H<sub>2</sub>O, which agrees best with its real behavior (p. <a href="#p172">172</a>), we can
find, similarly, that [Al<sup>3+</sup>] + [AlO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>] is a <em class="italic">minimum</em>, when
aluminium hydroxide is precipitated in such a way, that an excess <em class="italic">x</em>
of the hydroxide-ion is used, and
<em class="italic">x</em> = [HO<sup>−</sup>] = (3 K<sub>HOH</sub> × K<sub>Bas.S.P.</sub> / K<sub>Ac.S.P.</sub>)<sup>0.25</sup>,—where
K<sub>Ac.S.P.</sub> represents the
solubility-product constant for [AlO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>] × [H<sup>+</sup>]. That a
minimum loss of aluminium hydroxide would be suffered when the
favorable excess of the hydroxide-ion (<em class="italic">x</em>) is calculated on the
basis of the equation as given, may readily be seen by again assuming
definite values for K<sub>Bas.S.P.</sub> and K<sub>Ac.S.P.</sub>. It also appears
that this minimum loss<a id="FNanchor_394_417" href="#Footnote_394_417" class="fnanchor">394</a> of aluminium includes one-third as many
Al<sup>3+</sup> ions, as AlO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> ions—a relation corresponding, again,
to a saturated solution of aluminium aluminate, Al(AlO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.</p></div>

The displacement of hydrogen by a metal, like sodium, is the result of
the displacement of the <em class="italic">hydrogen-ion</em> (see Chapters XIV and XV). The
hydrogen-ion in fused sodium hydroxide is probably formed chiefly by the
secondary ionization of the hydroxide-ion (HO<sup>−</sup> ⇄ H<sup>+</sup> + O<sup>2−</sup>) (see Chap. XIII).
We cannot have positive ions, Na<sup>+</sup>, with negative ions, O<sup>2−</sup>, without having
some ions NaO<sup>−</sup>. (O<sup>2−</sup> + Na<sup>+</sup> ⥂ NaO<sup>−</sup>), NaOH, undoubtedly, is much <em class="italic">too</em>
<em class="italic">weak</em> an <em class="italic">acid</em> to form salts with bases in the presence of water. Such salts
would be decomposed by water (see below, p. <a href="#p180">180</a>), as sodium oxide, indeed,
is decomposed; we have Na─O─Na + HOH ⇄ 2 NaOH (see Chapter XIII for
a detailed discussion of this action). These relations sufficiently account for
the fact that salts of sodium hydroxide, in which it has the functions of an acid,
are not commonly formed. (<em class="italic">Cf.</em> Abegg, <em class="italic">Anorganische Chemie</em>, II, (1) p. 247.)</p></div>

<p>The sulphides of the metal ions of the zinc group are readily
precipitated by ammonium or sodium sulphide, but hydrogen
sulphide, in the presence of a small excess of a strong acid, such
as hydrochloric acid, does not precipitate any of these sulphides
(or any of the sulphides of the aluminium, the alkaline earth and
the alkali groups). Under the same conditions <em class="italic">the sulphides of
the metal ions of the silver group</em>, Ag<sup>+</sup>, Hg<sup>+</sup>, Pb<sup>2+</sup>, of <em class="italic">the copper
group</em>, Hg<sup>2+</sup>, Pb<sup>2+</sup>, Bi<sup>3+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Cd<sup>2+</sup>, and also of <em class="italic">the arsenic

Pt<sup>4+</sup>, Au<sup>+</sup>, and Au<sup>3+</sup>, are precipitated. Advantage is taken
of these relations in the following way, in systematic analysis:
after the separation of the silver group, by precipitation of the
difficultly soluble chlorides, hydrogen sulphide, in the presence of
an excess of acid, is used to precipitate the sulphides of the ions
of the copper and the arsenic groups, the two groups being precipitated
together. Hydrogen sulphide, under these conditions,
does not precipitate any sulphides of the zinc group or those of
any of the remaining groups. Hydrogen sulphide is used, in this
way, as one of the most valuable reagents in analytical work,
enabling the analyst to separate whole groups of metal ions from
other groups. There is also no other agent, equally important,
which is more likely to be used in a wrong way and to lead to error.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Ionization of Hydrogen Sulphide.</h4>—Before taking up the
theory of the separation of these groups by precipitation with
hydrogen sulphide in the presence of a strong acid, a discussion
of some of the characteristics of the reagent will be in place.
Hydrogen sulphide, like carbonic acid and other dibasic acids,
ionizes in two stages; it produces first hydrogen-ion and hydrosulphide-ion,
HS<sup>−</sup>, and this ion in turn dissociates, producing
hydrogen-ion and sulphide-ion, S<sup>2−</sup>. <a id="p200" class="xxpn">[p200]</a></div>

<p>For the first dissociation, HSH ⇄ H<sup>+</sup> + HS<sup>−</sup>, we have</p>

[H<sup>+</sup>] × [HS<sup>−</sup>] / [H<sub>2</sub>S] = K<sub>1</sub>

<div class="equationlabel">(I)</div>
</div>

<p>The value of the constant<a id="FNanchor_395_418" href="#Footnote_395_418" class="fnanchor">395</a> for this primary ionization of hydrogen
sulphide is 0.91E−7. It is apparent that hydrogen sulphide,
even in the primary ionization, is a very weak acid and
produces a very small concentration of hydrosulphide-ion. In a
solution, saturated at 25°, the total concentration of hydrogen
sulphide is approximately 0.1 molar, and the concentration of
hydrosulphide-ion, therefore, in the absence of any foreign acid,
at most<a id="FNanchor_396_419" href="#Footnote_396_419" class="fnanchor">396</a>
0.95E−4. The concentration of the dissolved, nonionized
hydrogen sulphide, [H<sub>2</sub>S], is practically a constant, if solutions
saturated with hydrogen sulphide under a given pressure,
say under atmospheric pressure, are considered. For such solutions,
then, we may put more

<p class="continue">The concentration of hydrosulphide-ion is, therefore, inversely
proportional to the concentration of hydrogen-ion. It is clear
that the addition of a strong acid, readily yielding concentrations

value of [H<sup>+</sup>] in a saturated aqueous solution of hydrogen sulphide)
will, as the result of the greatly increased total hydrogen-ion
concentration, reduce the concentration of hydrosulphide-ion to
correspondingly low values. For instance, the presence of 0.1
molar hydrochloric acid will increase the concentration of hydrogen-ion
close to a thousandfold and will reduce the concentration
of hydrosulphide-ion to 0.9E−7.</p>

<p>For the secondary ionization (see p. <a href="#p101">101</a>) of hydrogen sulphide,

0.95E−4, we have for the concentration of the sulphide-ion,

proportional</em> to the <em class="italic">square</em> of the <em class="italic">concentration</em> of <em class="italic">the hydrogen-ion</em>.
A thousandfold increase in the concentration of the
latter, which is very nearly the effect produced by the presence
of 0.1 molar hydrochloric acid ([H<sup>+</sup>] = 0.091), reduces the concentration
of sulphide-ion in the saturated aqueous solution a millionfold:
If we call [S<sup>2−</sup>]<sub>Ac.</sub> the concentration of the sulphide-ion in the
acid solution, [S<sup>2−</sup>]<sub>Ac.</sub> = (1.1E−23) / (0.091)<sup>2</sup> = 1.3E−21, whereas,
in the absence of acid, as found above, [S<sup>2−</sup>] = 1.2E−15.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the addition of alkali to hydrogen sulphide,
by neutralizing and suppressing the hydrogen-ion, and by forming
the <em class="italic">salts</em> MeSH and Me<sub>2</sub>S, will very greatly increase the concentrations
of the hydrosulphide-ion and of the sulphide-ion. Since
the constant for the secondary ionization of hydrogen sulphide
shows that HS<sup>−</sup> is an <em class="italic">exceedingly weak</em> acid, its salts, Me<sub>2</sub>S, are
very largely hydrolyzed, the constant for water being somewhat
greater<a id="FNanchor_400_423" href="#Footnote_400_423" class="fnanchor">400</a> than its own. According to Knox, in a 0.1 molar solution
of Na<sub>2</sub>S about 99% of the sulphide is hydrolyzed: Na<sub>2</sub>S +
H<sub>2</sub>O ⥂ NaSH + NaOH. In spite of this almost complete hydrolysis,
sufficient sodium sulphide remains in a solution of this
<a id="p202" class="xxpn">[p202]</a> substance, to yield a concentration of the sulphide-ion that is far
greater than that obtained from a solution of hydrogen sulphide.
In a 0.1 molar solution of sodium sulphide the concentration of
the sulphide-ion is, approximately, [S<sup>2−</sup>]<sub>alk.</sub> = 0.9E−3, as compared
with [S<sup>2−</sup>] = 1.2E−15 in a saturated solution of hydrogen
sulphide (25°, 760 mm.), and with 1.3E−21 in the same solution
in the presence of 0.1 molar hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p>Ammonium sulphide (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S is the salt of an extremely weak
acid with a much weaker base than sodium hydroxide, and it
is correspondingly more completely decomposed by water. In a
0.1 molar solution of the sulphide (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S, we find the approximate
concentration<a id="FNanchor_401_424" href="#Footnote_401_424" class="fnanchor">401</a> of the sulphide-ion [S<sup>2−</sup>]<sub>am.</sub> = 1.8E−6, as
compared with 0.9E−3 in a similar solution of Na<sub>2</sub>S. But the
concentration of sulphide-ion is still enormously greater than its
concentrations in hydrogen sulphide in the absence and in the
presence of acids (see above).</p>

<p>The following table<a id="FNanchor_402_425" href="#Footnote_402_425" class="fnanchor">402</a> contains a <em class="italic">summary of the concentrations

in the presence of 0.2 molar hydrochloric acid. In the
separation of the copper and arsenic groups from the zinc and
aluminium groups, a concentration of hydrogen-ion corresponding
to the presence of 0.15 to 0.25 molar hydrochloric acid is satisfactory
for an accurate separation for ordinary purposes.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Precipitation of Sulphides by Hydrogen Sulphide.</h4>—Although
the hydrosulphide-ion most likely takes part in the precipitation
of sulphides, the main effect appears to be due to the sulphide-ion.<a id="FNanchor_404_427" href="#Footnote_404_427" class="fnanchor">404</a>
The sulphides seem to be both more stable and less soluble,
than the hydrosulphides. It is very likely that hydrosulphides,
mixed with the sulphides, are precipitated to a certain extent,
but they are unstable, lose hydrogen sulphide and go over into
sulphides much more readily than hydroxides, as a rule, change
into oxides.<a id="FNanchor_405_428" href="#Footnote_405_428" class="fnanchor">405</a> The final condition of equilibrium, if one waited, in a
given case, until equilibrium was established, would depend, under
these conditions, rather on the concentration of the sulphide-ion
than on that of the hydrosulphide-ion, although the latter is present
in much greater concentrations than the former. For the sake
of simplifying the discussion of the theory of the separation of
metal ions by precipitation with hydrogen sulphide, the discussion
will be limited to the consideration of the sulphide-ion as the active
precipitating agent. As stated, this seems to be in accordance
with the known facts.</div>

<p>The absolute values of the solubilities of the various sulphides,
which are involved in the discussion, are known, with any degree
of accuracy, only in a few cases. The aim of the discussion will
be, therefore, to develop, rather, the relations in the values involved,
which may be readily determined. Wherever absolute quantities
can be given, they also will be referred to.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Theory of the Separation of Sulphides by Precipitation with
Hydrogen Sulphide. I. Precipitation of Ferrous Sulphide.</h4>—If
we prepare a solution of ferrous sulphate, containing 27.8 grams
of the salt, FeSO<sub>4</sub>, 7 H<sub>2</sub>O, in one liter (0.1 molar), we may call
[Fe<sup>2+</sup>] the concentration of the ferrous-ion in the solution. If such
a solution is saturated with hydrogen sulphide, under atmospheric
pressure, (<em class="italic">exp.</em>), ferrous sulphide is not precipitated. We would
decide, on the basis of the principle of the solubility-product, that
the reason no precipitate of ferrous sulphide is formed is, that the
product of the ion concentrations is <em class="italic">smaller</em> than the
<a id="p204" class="xxpn">[p204]</a> solubility-product
constant characteristic of the sulphide (p. <a href="#p151">151</a>);
[Fe<sup>2+</sup>] × [S<sup>2−</sup>] &lt; K<sub>FeS</sub>,
in which [S<sup>2−</sup>] is the concentration of sulphide-ion in
the solution thus saturated with hydrogen sulphide. If an alkali,
sodium or ammonium hydroxide, is added to the solution, a heavy
precipitate of ferrous sulphide is immediately formed (<em class="italic">exp.</em>).
The salts of hydrogen sulphide, like all common salts, as we have
just seen, are very much more highly ionized than is hydrogen
sulphide itself, and the addition of the alkali has the effect of
increasing enormously<a id="FNanchor_406_429" href="#Footnote_406_429" class="fnanchor">406</a> the concentration of sulphide-ion, say to
<em class="italic">x</em> [S<sup>2−</sup>] (p. <a href="#p202">202</a>). Under these conditions, the product of the ion
concentrations has evidently grown larger than the constant:
[Fe<sup>2+</sup>] × <em class="italic">x</em> [S<sup>2−</sup>] &gt; K<sub>FeS</sub>.</div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>II. Precipitation of Zinc Sulphide.</h4>—Now, if a solution of
zinc sulphate is prepared so as to contain 28.7 grams of
ZnSO<sub>4</sub>, 7 H<sub>2</sub>O, per liter, which would make it of the same molar concentration
as the ferrous sulphate solution, we may, in view of the fact
that analogous salts ionize approximately to the same extent in
solutions of the same concentration, consider the concentration,
[Zn<sup>2+</sup>], of zinc-ion to be practically the same as the concentration,
[Fe<sup>2+</sup>], of the ferrous-ion in the ferrous sulphate solution. We
may put [Zn<sup>2+</sup>] = [Fe<sup>2+</sup>].</div>

<p>If the solution of zinc sulphate is saturated with hydrogen sulphide,
under the same conditions as were used with the ferrous salt
solution (<em class="italic">exp.</em>), or if we add the zinc sulphate solution to the mixture
of ferrous sulphate and hydrogen sulphide (<em class="italic">exp.</em>), we immediately
obtain heavy white precipitates of zinc sulphide. We would
decide, therefore, on the basis of the principle of the solubility-product,
that in this case [Zn<sup>2+</sup>] × [S<sup>2−</sup>] &gt; K<sub>ZnS</sub>. Since we have
used hydrogen sulphide under practically the same conditions, we
may consider that [S<sup>2−</sup>], in this experiment,<a id="FNanchor_407_430" href="#Footnote_407_430" class="fnanchor">407</a> is the same as in the
<a id="p205" class="xxpn">[p205]</a> test with ferrous sulphate, and, by the conditions of the experiment,
we have also made [Zn<sup>2+</sup>] = [Fe<sup>2+</sup>]. The two factors of
the product are, therefore, the same, for the first moment, and we
may put [Fe<sup>2+</sup>] × [S<sup>2−</sup>] = [Zn<sup>2+</sup>] × [S<sup>2−</sup>] = P.</p>

<p>Since P is smaller than K<sub>FeS</sub> and larger than K<sub>ZnS</sub>, it is clear that
the <em class="italic">solubility-product constant for zinc sulphide must be smaller than
that for ferrous sulphide</em>. The solubility-product constants, for
similar salts, are a measure of their solubilities in water. We may
obtain their values by determining the solubilities of salts in pure
water, whenever the solubility is not affected by other chemical
changes. In the present instance, the quantitative measurements,
that have been made in this way, are open to question, owing to
the considerable hydrolysis which sulphides, as salts of a very weak
acid, undergo in solutions of such extreme dilution.<a id="FNanchor_408_431" href="#Footnote_408_431" class="fnanchor">408</a> Until such
relations have been taken into account quantitatively, it is better
to limit ourselves for the present to the more accessible question
of <em class="italic">relative</em> solubility.</p>

<p>It is a comparatively easy matter to determine the <em class="italic">relative
solubility</em> of zinc and ferrous sulphides. If equal quantities of the
equivalent solutions are mixed and a precipitant, ammonium
sulphide, <em class="italic">which would precipitate either sulphide, if its salt were
present alone</em>, is carefully and gradually added to the mixture, it
will precipitate first the less soluble one (see p. <a href="#p163">163</a>); and that one
alone can be present permanently (<em class="italic">i.e.</em> in equilibrium) in contact
with the solution containing the two salts. As a matter of fact,<a id="FNanchor_409_432" href="#Footnote_409_432" class="fnanchor">409</a>
<a id="p206" class="xxpn">[p206]</a> <em class="italic">we find that zinc sulphide is precipitated first, under conditions
permitting the precipitation of ferrous sulphide if no zinc sulphate
were present</em>, and the precipitate of zinc sulphide remains unchanged
in the presence of a mixture of the composition indicated (<em class="italic">exp.</em>).</p>

<p>It is clear, therefore, that the prediction, based on the conclusion
drawn from the application of the principle of the solubility-product,
is verified by experiment.</p>

<p>Now, closer examination of the solution of zinc sulphate, from
which zinc sulphide has been precipitated by the action of hydrogen
sulphide, shows, after the hydrogen sulphide has precipitated
as much sulphide as it can and the solution has been passed
through a filter, that a very considerable proportion of zinc salt
is still present in the filtrate, and we must ask why hydrogen
sulphide fails to precipitate the zinc completely. The concentration
of the zinc-ion has grown somewhat smaller, but that is
not the cause of the nonprecipitation of zinc sulphide under the
new conditions, since hydrogen sulphide will precipitate the sulphide,
if it is passed into a solution of zinc sulphate which contains
even a smaller concentration of zinc-ion than the filtrate, in which it
fails to give any further precipitate. If the filtrate is examined, it
is found to be <em class="italic">strongly acid</em>, since sulphuric acid has been liberated
by the action of hydrogen sulphide on zinc sulphate: ZnSO<sub>4</sub> +
H<sub>2</sub>S → ZnS ↓ + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Sulphuric acid is a strong acid, which
is very highly ionized, much more so than the exceedingly weak
acid hydrogen sulphide, and consequently, as the precipitation of
zinc sulphide proceeds, the <em class="italic">concentration of hydrogen-ion in the
solution rapidly grows larger and larger</em>. But, the greater the concentration
of the hydrogen-ion, the smaller is that of the sulphide-ion,
since the product [H<sup>+</sup>]<sup>2</sup> × [S<sup>2−</sup>] is a constant [equation (IV),
p. <a href="#p201">201</a>] for a solution kept saturated with hydrogen sulphide.
The sulphide-ion is reduced in concentration very much more
rapidly than is the zinc-ion.<a id="FNanchor_410_433" href="#Footnote_410_433" class="fnanchor">410</a> As [S<sup>2−</sup>] is a factor in the
<a id="p207" class="xxpn">[p207]</a> solubility-product of zinc sulphide, it is clear that
the value of this product
must grow rapidly smaller during the precipitation of zinc sulphide
from the solution, and that it may well, eventually, grow too
small to surpass the value of the solubility-product constant K<sub>ZnS</sub>.
Precipitation of zinc sulphide will then cease. Obviously, the suppression
of the sulphide-ion may be accomplished by the addition
of hydrochloric, sulphuric or any other strong acid to the zinc
sulphate solution in the first place, and then hydrogen sulphide
should fail to precipitate any zinc sulphide at all. In fact, if to
50 c.c. of the 0.1 molar zinc sulphate solution 2 c.c. of hexamolar
hydrochloric acid is added,<a id="FNanchor_411_434" href="#Footnote_411_434" class="fnanchor">411</a> hydrogen sulphide does not
precipitate even a trace of zinc sulphide (<em class="italic">exp.</em>).</p>

<p>We have found, then, that 0.1 molar zinc sulphate solution,
acidified with a small excess of hydrochloric acid, fails to produce
a precipitate of zinc sulphide, when it is saturated with hydrogen
sulphide. We must conclude that, under these circumstances, the
product of the ion concentrations is smaller than the solubility-product
constant for zinc sulphide: ([Zn<sup>2+</sup>] × [S<sup>2−</sup>] / <em class="italic">x</em>) &lt; K<sub>ZnS</sub>, the
new concentration of the sulphide-ion being represented by the
symbol [S<sup>2−</sup>] / <em class="italic">x</em>.</p>

<p>It would follow, from these considerations, that the action of
hydrochloric or sulphuric acid, in preventing the precipitation of
zinc sulphide, depends on their producing a sufficiently high concentration
of the hydrogen-ion, to keep the concentration of the
sulphide-ion, in a mixture of zinc sulphate and hydrogen sulphide,
below the point where the solution could become supersaturated
with zinc sulphide.
<a id="p208" class="xxpn">[p208]</a> <em class="italic">For exactly similar reasons, none of the
sulphides of the zinc group is precipitated by hydrogen sulphide in
(sufficiently) acid solutions.</em></p>

<p>It is evident, further, that, if a solution of zinc acetate (without
the addition of any acid) is substituted for the zinc sulphate
solution and is treated with hydrogen sulphide, an entirely different
result, quantitatively considered, must be obtained. By the
action of hydrogen sulphide on the acetate, acetic acid is liberated,
according to Zn(CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>S ⥂ ZnS ↓ + 2 CH<sub>3</sub>COOH.
As a <em class="italic">weak</em> acid, acetic acid produces much less hydrogen-ion than
is formed in equivalent solutions of sulphuric acid. Consequently,
<em class="italic">a much slighter suppression of the sulphide-ion</em> and a much more
<em class="italic">complete precipitation of zinc sulphide</em> from the acetate, than from
the sulphate solution, must result. Such is the case. Zinc sulphide
is, indeed, precipitated <em class="italic">quantitatively</em> by hydrogen sulphide from the
<em class="italic">acetate</em> solution.</p>

<p>This behavior of zinc
acetate<a id="FNanchor_412_435" href="#Footnote_412_435" class="fnanchor">412</a>—and
zinc salts of other <em class="italic">weak
acids</em> show, of course, the same behavior—represents one of the
pitfalls, into which the unwary analytical chemist is liable to
fall, when he uses hydrogen sulphide. The separation of groups
by hydrogen sulphide depends, as stated, on the fact, that, in
the presence of a certain concentration of hydrogen-ion, hydrogen
sulphide will not precipitate zinc sulphide and the remaining sulphides
of the zinc group. To secure this concentration of hydrogen-ion,
some hydrochloric acid is added to solutions, from which
hydrogen sulphide is expected to precipitate none but sulphides
of the copper and arsenic groups—and, as a rule, the purpose is
accomplished, as desired. It is evident, however, that if a solution
contains an acetate, say sodium acetate, or the salt of any
other weak acid, <em class="italic">e.g.</em> a borate or a phosphate, the addition of hydrochloric
acid will result, at least at first, in the <em class="italic">liberation</em> of the
<em class="italic">weaker acid</em> and will not produce the excess of hydrogen-ion,
required for the analysis. Zinc sulphide, and possibly nickel and
cobalt sulphides,<a href="#Footnote_412_435" class="fnanchor">412</a> may, under such conditions, be precipitated with
the sulphides of the groups mentioned. Unless provision is made,
therefore, <em class="italic">to insure a certain excess of hydrogen-ion</em> (p. <a href="#p213">213</a>), or
unless we are on our guard and look for zinc, nickel and cobalt in
<a id="p209" class="xxpn">[p209]</a> the analysis of the precipitate formed by hydrogen sulphide,<a id="FNanchor_413_436" href="#Footnote_413_436" class="fnanchor">413</a>
serious errors obviously could result. To add an inordinately
large excess of hydrochloric acid to mixtures, in order to avoid
this pitfall, will, as we shall presently see, only throw us more
certainly into still another error, to which we are exposed in the
use of this important reagent, hydrogen sulphide.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>III. Precipitation of Cadmium Sulphide.</h4>—Now, if a 0.1
molar solution of cadmium sulphate (22.6 grams of the salt,<a id="FNanchor_414_437" href="#Footnote_414_437" class="fnanchor">414</a>
CdSO<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, <em class="italic">per</em> liter) is prepared, equivalent, in concentration,
to the solutions of ferrous and zinc sulphates used previously, we
may consider that the concentration of cadmium-ion is, approximately,
the same as the concentrations of the ferrous-ion and zinc-ion
in the solutions of their sulphates. If the solution of cadmium
sulphate is added to the acidified solution of zinc sulphate, which
was saturated with hydrogen sulphide but from which no zinc
sulphide could be precipitated (<em class="italic">exp.</em>, p. <a href="#p207">207</a>), a heavy precipitate
of cadmium sulphide is at once obtained (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). Or, if 2 c.c. of
hexamolar hydrochloric acid is added to 50 c.c. of the cadmium
sulphate solution and the mixture is saturated with hydrogen
sulphide,<a id="FNanchor_415_438" href="#Footnote_415_438" class="fnanchor">415</a>
cadmium sulphide is precipitated readily (<em class="italic">exp.</em>) and, in
fact, quantitatively. We would decide, on the basis of the principle
of the solubility-product, that, in this mixture, precipitation
results because ([Cd<sup>2+</sup>] × [S<sup>2−</sup>] / <em class="italic">x</em>) &gt; K<sub>CdS</sub>.</div>

<p>By the conditions of the experiment we started with a concentration
of the cadmium-ion, [Cd<sup>2+</sup>], equal to the concentration,
[Zn<sup>2+</sup>], of the zinc-ion in the zinc sulphate solution, and with
the same concentration,<a href="#Footnote_415_438" class="fnanchor">415</a>
[S<sup>2−</sup>] / <em class="italic">x</em>, of sulphide-ion as was
used when hydrogen sulphide failed to precipitate zinc sulphide.
The corresponding factors of the products of the ion concentrations
are equal, at the beginning of the two experiments, and we may put
([Cd<sup>2+</sup>] × [S<sup>2−</sup>] / <em class="italic">x</em>) = ([Zn<sup>2+</sup>] × [S<sup>2−</sup>] / <em class="italic">x</em>) = P′.
We recall the fact, that we have already concluded, on the
basis of the principle of the solubility-product, that
[Zn<sup>2+</sup>] × [S<sup>2−</sup>] / <em class="italic">x</em>, or P′, is <em class="italic">smaller</em> than K<sub>ZnS</sub> (p. <a href="#p207">207</a>), and that
[Cd<sup>2+</sup>] × [S<sup>2−</sup>] / <em class="italic">x</em>, or P′, is <em class="italic">greater</em> than K<sub>CdS</sub>.</p>

<p>P′ being smaller than K<sub>ZnS</sub> and larger than K<sub>CdS</sub>, it is clear that
<a id="p210" class="xxpn">[p210]</a> K<sub>CdS</sub> is smaller than K<sub>ZnS</sub> and that cadmium sulphide must be the
<em class="italic">less soluble</em> of the two sulphides. As a matter of fact, if ammonium
sulphide is carefully added to a mixture of equal quantities of
the two salt solutions, cadmium sulphide is precipitated first,
and when practically all of the cadmium is precipitated, a final
precipitate of white zinc sulphide is obtained (<em class="italic">exp.</em>; see note,
p. <a href="#p205">205</a>). Or, if zinc sulphide is first precipitated by the addition
of a little ammonium sulphide to 25 c.c. of the 0.1 molar zinc sulphate
solution, care being taken to have zinc sulphate in excess,
and if 25 c.c. of the 0.1 molar cadmium sulphate solution is then
added to the mixture, the white zinc sulphide immediately gives
way to the less soluble yellow cadmium sulphide (<em class="italic">exp.</em>; see p. <a href="#p165">165</a>).
Cadmium sulphide is thus proved to be the <em class="italic">less soluble</em> of the two
sulphides, a result which confirms the prediction made above with
the aid of the principle of the solubility-product, and we may indeed
conclude that the solubility-product constant K<sub>CdS</sub> of cadmium
sulphide must be smaller than the constant K<sub>ZnS</sub> of zinc sulphide
(see pp. <a href="#p163">163</a>–<a href="#p168">168</a>, on fractional precipitation). We are, therefore,
also justified in deciding that CdS may well be precipitated from
acidulated solutions by hydrogen sulphide, when ZnS is not thus
precipitated, simply because K<sub>CdS</sub> is <em class="italic">sufficiently small</em> (CdS is sufficiently
insoluble) <em class="italic">to make the product of the ion concentrations</em>
[Cd<sup>2+</sup>] × [S<sup>2−</sup>] / <em class="italic">x</em>, <em class="italic">in spite of the extremely small value of</em> [S<sup>2−</sup>] / <em class="italic">x</em>,
<em class="italic">greater than the constant</em> K<sub>CdS</sub>, whereas the same small value of
[S<sup>2−</sup>] / <em class="italic">x</em> makes it impossible for the product
[Zn<sup>2+</sup>] × [S<sup>2−</sup>] / <em class="italic">x</em> to reach
the value of the <em class="italic">larger constant</em> K<sub>ZnS</sub>, required for the precipitation
of ZnS. Since cadmium sulphide may be precipitated quantitatively
under the conditions given, it is also evident that it may be
precipitated even when the concentration of the cadmium-ion also
has a rather small value. The relations, in regard to this point,
will be discussed presently.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Separation of the Copper and Arsenic Groups from the
Zinc Group.</h4>—Ferrous-ion and zinc-ion may be taken as typical
representatives of the ions of the <em class="italic">zinc group, whose sulphides are
not precipitated by hydrogen sulphide in the presence of a definite concentration
of hydrogen-ion</em>, cadmium-ion as a representative of the
<em class="italic">copper</em>, <em class="italic">silver</em> and <em class="italic">arsenic</em> groups, <em class="italic">whose sulphides are precipitated
under the same conditions</em>. The separation of the groups depends,
therefore, on the different solubilities of the sulphides of these
<a id="p211" class="xxpn">[p211]</a> groups, the sulphides of the zinc group being the most soluble.
Since even these sulphides are precipitated quantitatively by
ammonium sulphide and are very difficultly soluble, the separation
is a kind of fractional precipitation of difficultly soluble salts, in
which the fractionation is made possible and convenient by the
use of an agent, hydrogen sulphide, the concentration of whose
active precipitating component, the sulphide-ion, S<sup>2−</sup>, is easily
regulated and readily made sufficiently small, not to precipitate
even the difficultly soluble sulphides of the iron group.</div>

<p>Solubilities vary from salt to salt, and we have already found
that, in the zinc group, zinc sulphide is less soluble than the sulphide
of a second member of the group, ferrous sulphide, and that
the difference is revealed in a somewhat different behavior of their
salts toward hydrogen sulphide, when the action is studied in some
detail. Similar differences must be expected to exist among the
sulphides of the groups that hydrogen sulphide precipitates even in
the presence of an excess of hydrochloric acid. As these differences
are the sources of some of the most common and most serious
errors which analysts are liable to commit, the detailed study of
the action of hydrogen sulphide must be continued a little further.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Effect of a Large Excess of Acid.</h4>—The precipitation of
cadmium sulphide depends on the relation of the product of the
concentrations of the cadmium-ion and the sulphide-ion to the
solubility-product constant for cadmium sulphide (see the equation,
p. <a href="#p209">209</a>). Now, it is clear that if a <em class="italic">larger</em> and <em class="italic">larger excess of
hydrogen-ion</em> is introduced by the addition of more concentrated
hydrochloric acid to the cadmium sulphate solution, the concentration
of sulphide-ion is correspondingly <em class="italic">reduced</em>.<a id="FNanchor_416_439" href="#Footnote_416_439" class="fnanchor">416</a> The point
might be reached, where the sulphide-ion factor becomes so small,
that the product of the ion concentrations remains smaller than
the value K<sub>CdS</sub>, required for precipitation of cadmium sulphide.</div>

<p>In fact, if a large excess<a id="FNanchor_417_440" href="#Footnote_417_440" class="fnanchor">417</a> of hydrochloric acid is added to 50 c.c.
<a id="p212" class="xxpn">[p212]</a> of the 0.1 molar solution of cadmium sulphate, hydrogen sulphide
fails to precipitate any of the sulphide (<em class="italic">exp.</em>).</p>

<p>But, if a few cubic centimeters of a 0.1 molar solution of cupric
sulphate (25.0 grams of CuSO<sub>4</sub>, 5 H<sub>2</sub>O, per liter) are added to the
solution from which hydrogen sulphide fails to precipitate cadmium
sulphide, cupric sulphide is at once precipitated. And, if
15 c.c. of concentrated hydrochloric acid are added to 50 c.c. of
the 0.1 molar cupric sulphate solution, there results a mixture
corresponding to the cadmium sulphate solution from which hydrogen
sulphide fails to precipitate CdS; we find that hydrogen
sulphide will <em class="italic">precipitate</em> the <em class="italic">sulphide of copper</em> very readily, even
under these adverse conditions (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). Cupric sulphide must be
even less soluble in water than cadmium sulphide,<a id="FNanchor_418_441" href="#Footnote_418_441" class="fnanchor">418</a> and there is
no difficulty in showing that such is the case. If ammonium sulphide,
or hydrogen sulphide, is gradually introduced into a mixture
of 25 c.c. each of the 0.1 molar sulphate solutions, cupric sulphide
is precipitated first, and, if the precipitate is collected in fractions,
<a id="p213" class="xxpn">[p213]</a> pure yellow cadmium sulphide is precipitated last.<a id="FNanchor_419_442" href="#Footnote_419_442" class="fnanchor">419</a> Or, if 25 c.c.
of 0.1 molar cupric sulphate is added to the mixture in which a
precipitate of cadmium sulphide displaced the more soluble zinc
sulphide (p. <a href="#p210">210</a>), the yellow sulphide will, in turn, give way to
the less soluble black sulphide of copper (<em class="italic">exp.</em>).</p>

<p>We find thus that the precipitation of cadmium sulphide, by
hydrogen sulphide in acid solution, <em class="italic">can be prevented by the presence
of an excess of hydrochloric acid</em>, which does not prevent the precipitation
of the less soluble cupric sulphide.<a id="FNanchor_420_443" href="#Footnote_420_443" class="fnanchor">420</a> The fact, then,
that, in an analysis of some unknown mixture, hydrogen sulphide
produces a precipitate in acid solution, must not be considered as
evidence that the conditions are such as to insure the precipitation
of all the sulphides of the groups, which we intend to precipitate.
To avoid error, conditions must be such as to insure the complete
precipitation of the more soluble as well as the less soluble sulphides.
The sulphides of <em class="italic">cadmium</em> and <em class="italic">lead</em>, in particular, and, to a
lesser degree, the sulphides of antimony and tin, are most liable to
remain unprecipitated and thus escape detection in systematic
analysis. This is a matter of special importance, also, in detecting
traces of the ions of these metals, especially of lead, which is a
slow cumulative poison, even when absorbed in minute amounts,
and which analysts must therefore be able to detect, even in
traces, with absolute certainty. It is clear, from a consideration
of the product of the ion concentrations, as affecting the precipitation
or nonprecipitation of such a sulphide, that a much
smaller excess of acid will prevent the precipitation of the last
traces of lead sulphide, and, therefore, of all of it, if only traces
are present, than will interfere with the precipitation of the sulphide
in bulk.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Desirable Concentration of Acid (of Hydrogen-ion) and
an Indicator for Correct Acidification.</h4>—Summarizing the conclusions
reached in regard to the conditions necessary for a successful
separation of the copper and arsenic groups, by means of
hydrogen sulphide, from the zinc and aluminium groups, we find
<a id="p214" class="xxpn">[p214]</a> that the concentration of the hydrogen-ion, in the solution to be
treated with hydrogen sulphide, is the most important factor.
Too great a concentration, as has just been shown, will prevent
the precipitation of all, or part, of the more soluble sulphides of the
former groups, notably of the sulphides of cadmium and lead, which
is a common error in the laboratory. Too small a concentration,
which may result when a salt of a weak acid, such as an acetate,
borate or phosphate is present, may lead, as was shown above,
to the precipitation of part of the zinc group, notably of zinc
and possibly of nickel and cobalt, with the copper and arsenic
groups, and thus lead to other errors. For the ordinary purposes
of analysis, requiring the precipitation of say one milligram of any
ion from 100 c.c. solution (one-tenth per cent, if one gram of
substance is used for analysis), a concentration of hydrogen-ion of
0.1 to 0.3 gram-ion per liter forms a good basis for work.<a id="FNanchor_421_444" href="#Footnote_421_444" class="fnanchor">421</a> The
presence of this concentration of hydrogen-ion, irrespective of the
possible presence of weak organic or inorganic acids, may be readily
insured by a simple test with an appropriate indicator. <em class="italic">Methyl-violet</em><a id="FNanchor_422_445" href="#Footnote_422_445" class="fnanchor">422</a>
is suitable for such a purpose, because it is sensitive only
to the rather high concentrations of hydrogen-ion required: 0.1 c.c.
or two drops of 0.05 to 0.1 molar hydrochloric acid, added to
an equal volume of a very dilute solution (1 : 12,500) of the indicator,
changes its color to a <em class="italic">pure blue</em>; 0.2 to 0.25 molar acid, used
similarly, turns the indicator to a <em class="italic">blue-green</em> tint, and 0.33 molar
acid produces a <em class="italic">yellow</em> or <em class="italic">yellow-green</em> hue. The <em class="italic">blue-green tint</em>, with
which one becomes easily familiar, and which can, indeed, always
be prepared for matching tints, may be used to recognize speedily,
and with sufficient accuracy, a concentration of the hydrogen-ion
of the strength desired, irrespective of its source.<a id="FNanchor_423_446" href="#Footnote_423_446" class="fnanchor">423</a></div>

<p>If an analyst aims to find even smaller quantities of a particular
metal ion, <em class="italic">e.g.</em> traces of lead, the ordinary method of analysis
<a id="p215" class="xxpn">[p215]</a> may be modified, the source of error in the precipitation of
traces of lead sulphide being kept in mind.<a id="FNanchor_424_447" href="#Footnote_424_447" class="fnanchor">424</a></p>

<p>Besides the complications mentioned, and provided against in
the way discussed, there is still one more complication in the
use of hydrogen sulphide: this is in the matter of the precipitation
of <em class="italic">arsenic</em> sulphide from solutions containing <em class="italic">arsenic in the
pentavalent condition</em>. Since the interpretation of this complication
and the explanation of the methods for avoiding the errors,
which may arise therefrom, are necessarily intimately connected
with the chemical behavior of arsenic acid, this subject will be
considered in the discussion of the arsenic group (Chapter XIII).</p>

The concentration of the hydrogen-ion is really a little
greater than that of the hydrosulphide-ion, as a result of the

In carrying out this <em class="italic">fractional precipitation</em> a very
dilute solution of ammonium sulphide is used, so as to prevent
the mechanical enclosure of black ferrous sulphide, which would
discolor the white sulphide. The ammonium sulphide solution should
be saturated with hydrogen sulphide, to prevent the precipitation
of green ferrous-ferric oxide by an excess of free ammonia. It is
best to prepare a set of the precipitates and to preserve them in
well-stoppered vessels, and not to try to take the time and care
necessary to effect a perfect fractionation as a lecture experiment.
The presence of the ferrous sulphate, in the supernatant liquid above
the first precipitate of zinc sulphide, may be readily demonstrated
by pouring off some of the solution and adding an excess of ammonium
sulphide to it. Of course, it is also perfectly legitimate, and
easier, to precipitate first zinc sulphide from a pure zinc sulphate
solution and then to add ferrous sulphate solution to the mixture
and to preserve the mixture. If the zinc sulphide were not the
less soluble, it would be rapidly converted into the black ferrous
sulphide. (See p. <a href="#p165">165</a>, and see below, pp. <a href="#p210">210</a>, <a href="#p213">213</a>, where similar

When 10% of the zinc in a 0.1 molar solution has been

[H<sup>+</sup>] in a saturated H<sub>2</sub>S solution (p. <a href="#p200">200</a>); if the presence
of a little sulphuric acid in the original zinc sulphate solution,
resulting from a slight hydrolysis of the salt, is ignored, the
concentration of the sulphide-ion is decreased roughly (200)<sup>2</sup>

The value of the solubility-product constant for cupric
sulphide, at 25°, was determined by Knox (<em class="italic">loc. cit.</em>): [Cu<sup>2+</sup>] ×
[S<sup>2−</sup>] = 1.2E−42, corresponding to a concentration of 1.1E−21 of
cupric-ion. Mercuric sulphide was found even less soluble:
[Hg<sup>2+</sup>] × [S<sup>2−</sup>] = 2.8E−54, and its behavior agrees with such a relation
(Lab. Manual, p. 50, § 2). The solubility-product constant
for lead sulphide, which resembles cadmium sulphide in the fact that
a large excess of acid prevents its precipitation, was found to be
[Pb<sup>2+</sup>] × [S<sup>2−</sup>] = 2.6E−15, the constant being about 10<sup>27</sup>
times as large as the constant for cupric sulphide. This value
for the solubility-product constant for lead sulphide must either
be considerably larger than the true value or lead must be easily
precipitated as a hydrosulphide, Pb(SH)<sub>2</sub>, since solutions in
which the product of the ion concentrations, [Pb<sup>2+</sup>] × [S<sup>2−</sup>],
is very much smaller than the constant given, readily precipitate
lead sulphide. Thus Noyes and Bray [<em class="italic">J. Am. Chem. Soc.</em>, <em class="bold">29</em>,
137 (1907)] report it possible to precipitate 1 to 2 milligrams of
lead-ion in 100 c.c. of solution (say [Pb<sup>2+</sup>] = 1E−4) with hydrogen
sulphide in the presence of 4 c.c. of hydrochloric acid (sp. gr.
1.12), for which, approximately, [H<sup>+</sup>] = 0.25. Then (equation (IV),
p. <a href="#p201">201</a>) [S<sup>2−</sup>] = (1.1E−23) / (0.25)<sup>2</sup> = 1.8E−22, and
[Pb<sup>2+</sup>] × [S<sup>2−</sup>] = 1E−4 × 1.8E−22 = 1.8E−26, which is a much lower value than
that given by Knox, and which still is not claimed to represent the
limit of insolubility. Experiments, made in this laboratory, confirm
this result and show further, that lead-ion in a concentration of
1E−5 is precipitated in the presence of 0.25 molar hydrochloric acid
([H<sup>+</sup>] = 0.22). Then [S<sup>2−</sup>] = 2.3E−22 and
[Pb<sup>2+</sup>] × [S<sup>2−</sup>] = 2.3E−22 × 10<sup>−5</sup> = 2E−27,

<p>We will now turn to the consideration of a series of reactions
involving the behavior of so-called "complex ions," which are very
frequently met with in the various analytical groups and which
offer valuable methods of separation and identification of ions.
The behavior of silver nitrate solution towards ammonia forms
a convenient point of attack in taking up the general subject.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Action of Ammonia on Silver
Nitrate.</h4>—Addition of ammonium hydroxide solution to
silver nitrate (<em class="italic">exp.</em>) results in
the formation of a brown precipitate of silver oxide (and
silver hydroxide). We may consider the supernatant liquid to
be saturated with silver hydroxide (this is in equilibrium
with silver oxide), and for the saturated solution we may put
[Ag<sup>+</sup>] × [HO<sup>−</sup>] = K<sub>AgOH</sub>.</div>

<p>If more ammonium hydroxide is added to the mixture, the precipitate
dissolves readily. The excess of ammonium hydroxide
must increase the concentration of hydroxide-ion and, if no
other action occurred, we should, according to the principle of
the solubility-product, expect that the precipitate would thereby
be slightly increased (p. <a href="#p145">145</a>), rather than that it should be dissolved
so readily. Since solution results even when the value of
the one factor, [HO<sup>−</sup>], of the product is increased, we must suspect
that the value of the other factor, the concentration [Ag<sup>+</sup>] of
silver-ion, is in some way made much smaller by the addition
of the excess of ammonium hydroxide. Recalling the fact that
aluminium hydroxide is soluble in excess of sodium hydroxide,
as the result of its amphoteric character, a solution of sodium
aluminate NaAlO<sub>2</sub> being obtained, we might suspect that silver
hydroxide also has amphoteric properties, <em class="italic">i.e.</em> that it might be
capable of ionizing into "argentate ions," AgO<sup>−</sup>, and hydrogen
ions, AgOH ⇄ AgO<sup>−</sup> + H<sup>+</sup>. If such be the case, the nonionized
silver hydroxide is in equilibrium, not only with the solid phase,
<a id="p217" class="xxpn">[p217]</a> but also with two sets of ions,</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
<table class="tableinline" summary="equilibrium equation">

<p class="continue">and we must have <em class="italic">two</em> solubility-product constants, one corresponding
to the basic ionization (see above) and the other corresponding
to the acid ionization, and [AgO<sup>−</sup>] × [H<sup>+</sup>] = K′<sub>AgOH</sub>.</p>

<p>If silver hydroxide have acid properties, the addition of an
alkali must suppress the hydrogen-ion and the hydroxide will go
into solution as an argentate, MeAgO. We find, however, that
sodium or potassium hydroxide, which would form an argentate
very much more readily than ammonium hydroxide, has
no solvent action on silver hydroxide (<em class="italic">exp.</em>); on the contrary,
quantitative experiments show that the alkali makes the hydroxide
still less soluble than in pure water—as demanded by the
solubility-product for the basic ionization. It is thus evident,
that the solvent action of ammonium hydroxide is not due to its
basic functions. We would suspect that we have here an action,
in which <em class="italic">ammonia</em> is the active component, the product of a
form of dissociation of ammonium hydroxide, of which the fixed
alkalies are incapable.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Complex Silver-Ammonium<a id="FNanchor_425_448" href="#Footnote_425_448" class="fnanchor">425</a>-Ion.</h4>—For a solution of
ammonia, in water, we have the reversible reactions:
<a id="p218" class="xxpn">[p218]</a> HO<sup>−</sup> + H<sup>+</sup> + NH<sub>3</sub> ⇄ NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> + HO<sup>−</sup> ⇄ NH<sub>4</sub>OH,
and we note that a molecule of
ammonia appears to combine first with a hydrogen ion, to form an
ammonium ion, and this then forms ammonium hydroxide with the
hydroxide ion. This suggests that ammonia may have the capacity
to combine with positive ions other than hydrogen ion, and
with metal hydroxides other than water. For an analogous
reaction of ammonia with silver ion and with silver hydroxide,
we would have:</div>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
NH<sub>3</sub> + Ag<sup>+</sup> + HO<sup>−</sup> ⇄ (NH<sub>3</sub>Ag)<sup>+</sup> + HO<sup>−</sup> ⇄ (NH<sub>3</sub>Ag)OH.
</div></div>

<p>For the condition of equilibrium between ammonia, the silver-ion
and the silver-ammonium-ion, we would have<a id="FNanchor_426_449" href="#Footnote_426_449" class="fnanchor">426</a>:</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
[NH<sub>3</sub>] × [Ag<sup>+</sup>] / [NH<sub>3</sub>Ag<sup>+</sup>] = K.
</div></div>

<p>Experimental investigations of the quantitative relations, obtaining
in ammoniacal solutions containing silver compounds,
show that <em class="italic">no constant</em> value is obtained for the ratio, as just developed.
But the experimental data show equally conclusively,<a id="FNanchor_427_450" href="#Footnote_427_450" class="fnanchor">427</a>
that a constant is obtained, <em class="italic">when the concentration of the ammonia
is raised to the second power, in the mathematical statement</em>.</p>

<p>The significance of this change in the mathematical relation,
it will be recalled (p. <a href="#p094">94</a>), is that two molecules of ammonia must
combine with one silver ion to form an ion [(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Ag]<sup>+</sup>, whereas
in the formation of the ammonium ion, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, we have a single
molecule of ammonia combining with one hydrogen ion. We
have then</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
2 NH<sub>3</sub> + Ag<sup>+</sup> + HO<sup>−</sup> ⇄ [(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Ag]<sup>+</sup> + HO<sup>−</sup> ⇄ [(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Ag]OH.
</div></div>

<p>We would thus have a silver-ammonium ion, [(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Ag]<sup>+</sup>, and
its hydroxide, silver-ammonium hydroxide, corresponding to the
<a id="p219" class="xxpn">[p219]</a> ammonium ion and its hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide. The
properties of ammoniacal solutions of silver oxide are in entire
agreement with this conception. The hydroxide is a stronger base
than barium hydroxide.<a id="FNanchor_428_451" href="#Footnote_428_451" class="fnanchor">428</a> It forms salts, [(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Ag]X, in which
silver appears as part of a so-called positive "complex ion."
The hydroxide, like ammonium hydroxide, is unstable and is only
known in solution and in the presence of free ammonia, exactly
as is the case for ammonium hydroxide. The mathematical
equation expressing the equilibrium conditions for the complex ion,</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
[NH<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2</sup> × [Ag<sup>+</sup>] / [(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Ag<sup>+</sup>] = K<sub>Instability</sub>,
</div></div>

<p class="continue">gives a <em class="italic">definite measure</em> of the <em class="italic">stability</em> of this complex ion. It is
clear, that the <em class="italic">larger</em> the constant, the more <em class="italic">unstable</em> the complex
ion would be, and so the constant is called the <em class="italic">Instability Constant</em><a id="FNanchor_429_452" href="#Footnote_429_452" class="fnanchor">429</a>
of the complex silver-ammonium-ion. Bodländer found the
value of the constant to be 6.8E−8 at 25°.<a id="FNanchor_430_453" href="#Footnote_430_453" class="fnanchor">430</a></p>

<p>According to the composition of the complex ion, two molecules
of ammonia should be required for every molecule of silver
nitrate, to produce a solution containing the nitrate of the complex
ion: Ag<sup>+</sup> + NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> + 2 NH<sub>3</sub> ⇄ [(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Ag]<sup>+</sup> + NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>.
As a matter of
fact, 20 c.c. of a molar solution of ammonium hydroxide (= 200 c.c.
of a 0.1 molar solution) must be added to 100 c.c. of a 0.1 molar
solution of silver nitrate, to convert the silver nitrate into the salt
of the complex silver-ammonium-ion. If the ammonium hydroxide
solution is allowed to flow slowly, from a pipette, into the silver
nitrate solution, we find that the last trace of the precipitated
silver hydroxide redissolves just as the <em class="italic">last</em> drop or two of the 20 c.c.
is added to the mixture (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). Working more exactly, Reychler<a id="FNanchor_431_454" href="#Footnote_431_454" class="fnanchor">431</a>
found that the addition of ammonia to a silver nitrate solution, in
the proportion of two molecules of the former to one of the nitrate,
does not change the freezing-point of the solution, and therefore
<a id="p220" class="xxpn">[p220]</a> does not increase the total number of molecules in the solution.
This result agrees with the conception that two molecules of
ammonia combine with one silver ion to form a complex ion.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Application in Analysis.</h4>—Turning now to the consideration
of the bearing of these relations on the detection of silver-ion in
analysis, we may conclude, in the first place, from the value of the
constant as given, that only a <em class="italic">small proportion</em> of the total silver
in such ammoniacal solutions is present in the form of silver-ion;
but, in the second place, there is, at least, a <em class="italic">portion</em> of the silver
present in the form of its ion—it is <em class="italic">not entirely</em> suppressed; and,
in the third place, it is clear, from the form of the equilibrium
equation, that any <em class="italic">excess</em> of <em class="italic">ammonia</em> must very rapidly reduce
the <em class="italic">concentration of silver-ion</em> in such solutions.</div>

<p>The bearing of these relations, which, it will be noted, concern
<em class="italic">concentrations of silver-ion</em>, can best be seen by working with solutions
of definite concentrations.</p>

<p>If the solution we have just prepared is diluted with water to
200 c.c., a 0.05 molar solution of [(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Ag]NO<sub>3</sub> is formed. In
such a solution, the concentration, [Ag<sup>+</sup>], of the silver-ion is only
0.0009,<a id="FNanchor_432_455" href="#Footnote_432_455" class="fnanchor">432</a> whereas in 0.05 molar silver nitrate solution it is 0.0435.
It is clear that the reactions of the silver-ion will not be observed
as readily in such an ammoniacal solution as in a solution of silver
nitrate, which contains the same concentration of <em class="italic">total silver</em>. That
such is the case, may be readily demonstrated as follows: the
addition of 1 c.c. of molar sodium bromate to 10 c.c. of 0.05 molar
silver nitrate immediately forms a heavy precipitate of the moderately
difficultly soluble bromate, AgBrO<sub>3</sub>, while the same addition
to 10 c.c. of the 0.05 molar silver-ammonium nitrate solution produces
no precipitate whatever (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). <a id="p221" class="xxpn">[p221]</a></p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p>A liter of water dissolves 0.025 mole (6 grams) of silver bromate<a id="FNanchor_433_456" href="#Footnote_433_456" class="fnanchor">433</a> at 18°.
If the same degree of ionization be assumed for it as for a 0.025 molar solution
of the analogous salt, silver nitrate, AgNO<sub>3</sub>, 90% of the silver bromate in
the saturated solution is ionized. The solubility-product constant then is
[Ag<sup>+</sup>] × [BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>] = (0.025 × 0.9)<sup>2</sup> = 0.0005.</p>

<p>When 1 c.c. of molar sodium bromate is added to 10 c.c. of 0.05 molar
silver nitrate, each salt is ionized 80% in the mixture, and [Ag<sup>+</sup>] = 0.05 ×
0.8 × 10 / 11 = 0.037 and [BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>] = (1 × 1 / 11) × 0.8 = 0.072. Then the
product of the ion concentrations, [Ag<sup>+</sup>] × [BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>] = 0.037 × 0.072 = 0.0027,
is considerably larger than the constant 0.0005 and precipitation follows.</p>

<p>But, when 1 c.c. of molar sodium bromate is added to 10 c.c. of a 0.05 molar
silver-ammonium nitrate solution, the concentration of silver-ion<a id="FNanchor_434_457" href="#Footnote_434_457" class="fnanchor">434</a> is 0.00085
and the product of the ion concentrations, [Ag<sup>+</sup>] × [BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>] = 0.00085 × 0.072 = 6E−5,
is smaller than the constant; the solution will not be saturated with
silver bromate and no precipitate is formed.</p></div>

<p>On the other hand, if 1 c.c. of a 0.1 molar solution of sodium
chloride is added to 10 c.c. of 0.05 molar silver-ammonium nitrate
solution, a very decided precipitate of silver chloride is
formed (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). The difference in the action of the sodium bromate
and the chloride lies in the fact that silver chloride is 2500
times as insoluble as is silver bromate, and the chloride may be
precipitated from solutions containing a <em class="italic">very much smaller concentration
of the silver-ion</em> than is required for the precipitation of
silver bromate.</p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p>The quantitative relations for the chloride are as follows: a liter of water
dissolves 0.002 gram, or 1.4E−5 mole, of silver chloride at 25°,<a id="FNanchor_435_458" href="#Footnote_435_458" class="fnanchor">435</a> and the solubility-product
constant at 25° is [Ag<sup>+</sup>] × [Cl<sup>−</sup>] = (1.4E−5)<sup>2</sup> = 2E−10.
Now, if 1 c.c. of 0.1 molar sodium chloride is added to 10 c.c. of 0.05 molar
silver-ammonium nitrate, we have,<a id="FNanchor_436_459" href="#Footnote_436_459" class="fnanchor">436</a> for the first moment, [Ag<sup>+</sup>] = 8.9E−4 and
<a id="p222" class="xxpn">[p222]</a> [Cl<sup>−</sup>] = 0.008, and [Ag<sup>+</sup>] × [Cl<sup>−</sup>] = 8.9E−4 × 0.008 = 7E−6, which is
much larger than the solubility-product constant, and precipitation must take
place. The precipitate will be quite a heavy one: as silver-ion is removed
from solution, the complex ion must decompose and furnish a new supply of
silver-ion, and precipitation must continue until the excess of ammonia, which
is liberated by the decomposition of the complex ion
(Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> + Cl<sup>−</sup> → AgCl ↓ + 2 NH<sub>3</sub>),
suppresses the silver-ion sufficiently to satisfy, with the
diminished concentration of chloride-ion, the solubility-product constant of
silver chloride.</p></div>

<p>It is clear that, while the reactions of silver-ion are not obtained
<em class="italic">as readily</em> in the ammoniacal solution as in an equivalent solution
of silver nitrate (bromate experiment), nevertheless more sensitive
tests show that a <em class="italic">small portion</em> of the silver still is present as <em class="italic">silver-ion</em>
in the ammoniacal solution (chloride experiment).</p>

<p>This brings us to our third point, the influence of an excess of
ammonia on the concentration of silver-ion and on its reactions.
It is evident, from the form of the equilibrium equation (p. <a href="#p219">219</a>),
that any excess of ammonia must very rapidly reduce the concentration
of silver-ion. We may ask <em class="italic">what excess will be required to
prevent the precipitation of silver chloride</em> in the experiment just tried.</p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p>The question may be answered as follows: The concentration of chloride-ion,
when 1 c.c. of 0.1 molar sodium chloride is added to 10 c.c. of 0.05 molar
[Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]NO<sub>3</sub>, no precipitate being formed, will be 0.1 × (1 / 11) × 0.87,
the solution being diluted 1 to 11 and the percentage of ionization of a salt
MeX being approximately 87% in 0.05 to 0.06 molar concentration. For
a solution containing this concentration of chloride-ion, the concentration
[Ag<sup>+</sup>] of silver-ion, <em class="italic">which may just be present</em> <em class="bold">without</em> <em class="italic">leading to the precipitation
of silver chloride</em> (<em class="italic">i.e.</em> for the saturated solution) is, according to the principle
of the solubility-product,</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
[Ag<sup>+</sup>] = K<sub>S.P.</sub> / [Cl<sup>−</sup>] = (2E−10) / (0.1 × 0.87 × 1 / 11).
</div></div>

<p class="continue">Further, in the presence of an excess of ammonia, practically all of the silver
is present in the complex form, and, [Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>] = 0.05 × 0.87 × 10 / 11
the 0.05 molar solution being diluted 10 parts to 11 and the salt being 87%
ionized.</p>

<p>If we call <em class="italic">x</em> the concentration of free ammonia required to reduce the concentration
of silver-ion to the small value indicated, we may put</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
<table class="tableinline" summary="equilibrium equation">
<tr>
 <td>[NH<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2</sup> × [Ag<sup>+</sup>]</td>

 <td class="bt">(0.05 × 0.87 × 10 / 11)</td></tr>
</table>
</div></div>

<p class="continue">Solving for <em class="italic">x</em>, we obtain <em class="italic">x</em> = [NH<sub>3</sub>] = 0.33. The concentration
of free ammonia, necessary to prevent precipitation of silver
chloride in this system, is then
<a id="p223" class="xxpn">[p223]</a> 0.33, instead of 0.0018, present in the original solution. Now, 11 c.c. of 0.33
molar ammonia is equal to 11 × 0.33 / 6, or 0.61 c.c. hexamolar ammonia.<a id="FNanchor_437_460" href="#Footnote_437_460" class="fnanchor">437</a></p></div>

<p>Calculations, based on the solubility-product constant of silver
chloride and on the instability constant of silver-ammonium-ion,
lead, thus, to the conclusion that an excess of 0.61 c.c. of hexamolar
ammonia is required, in 10 c.c. of 0.05 molar [Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]NO<sub>3</sub>, to
prevent the precipitation of silver chloride by 1 c.c. of 0.1 molar
sodium chloride. Conversely, this excess of ammonia will be required
to <em class="italic">redissolve the precipitate</em> of silver chloride, formed when
1 c.c. of 0.1 molar sodium chloride solution is added to 10 c.c. of
0.05 molar [Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]NO<sub>3</sub>. The following experiment shows that
such is the case.</p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p><em class="smcap">Exp.</em> 1 c.c. of 0.1 molar sodium chloride is added to 10 c.c. of 0.05 molar
silver-ammonium nitrate, prepared as described on p. <a href="#p220">220</a>; hexamolar ammonia
is slowly added to the mixture from a 1 c.c. pipette, graduated in twentieths
of a cubic centimeter. The precipitate will be seen to be just about
<em class="italic">completely dissolved</em> when 0.6 to 0.65 c.c. of the ammonia solution has been
used.</p></div>

<p>We find, in this way, that the equilibrium equation for the instability
constant of the complex silver-ammonium-ion, together
with the principle of the solubility-product, allows a <em class="italic">quantitative
interpretation</em> of the problem of the behavior of ammoniacal silver
solutions, as far as the detection of silver by the precipitation of
its salts is concerned.</p>

<p>If a still larger excess of ammonia is used (<em class="italic">exp.</em>), even the addition
of a 10% solution of sodium chloride fails to precipitate the
chloride, and, <em class="italic">vice versa</em>, ammonia in excess will readily redissolve
a heavy precipitate of silver chloride (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). Advantage is taken
of this fact in the separation and identification of silver-ion
(Laboratory Manual, <em class="italic">q. v.</em>).</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the addition of potassium bromide,
iodide or sulphide to the ammoniacal solution, in which
sodium chloride fails to precipitate any silver chloride, will still
precipitate silver bromide, iodide or sulphide readily (<em class="italic">exp.</em>).
Judged by the line of argument used above, in contrasting the
behavior of silver bromate and silver chloride, these silver salts
<a id="p224" class="xxpn">[p224]</a> must be still less soluble than the chloride. Experiment proves,
that such is, indeed, the case.<a id="FNanchor_438_461" href="#Footnote_438_461" class="fnanchor">438</a></p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p>Silver iodide is so insoluble, that ammonia<a id="FNanchor_439_462" href="#Footnote_439_462" class="fnanchor">439</a> may be used to separate it, with
a considerable degree of accuracy, from silver chloride, and this separation
forms the basis of a method to detect chloride-ion in the presence of an iodide.
If a solution with a <em class="italic">limited concentration of ammonia</em> is used, the method may be
extended also to the separation of chlorides from bromides (see Chap. XVI).<a id="FNanchor_440_463" href="#Footnote_440_463" class="fnanchor">440</a></p></div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Complex Metal-Ammonium Ions of Copper, Cadmium, etc.</h4>—Quite
a number of metal ions are capable of forming more or less
stable complex ions with ammonia. For analytical purposes, the
most interesting of such complex ions, aside from the silver-ammonium-ion,
are those formed by cupric, cadmium, zinc and
nickel ions, the most important of which represent bivalent complex
ions of the composition<a id="FNanchor_441_464" href="#Footnote_441_464" class="fnanchor">441</a> Me(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub><sup>2+</sup>. The following instability

<p>Cupri-ammonium-ion is far more intensely blue than cupric-ion
and its color is used as one of the tests to identify copper
in its salts. Nickel-ammonium-ion is also blue, a much paler
blue, and its color must not be mistaken as indicating the presence
of a dilute solution of cupric-ammonium-ion. The same kind of
relations obtain for these complex ions as for silver-ammonium-ion.
For instance, a salt like cupric phosphate, which is readily
precipitated from cupric sulphate solutions, is not precipitated
from the ammoniacal solutions containing an excess of ammonia
(<em class="italic">exp.</em>), while the very much less soluble<a id="FNanchor_443_466" href="#Footnote_443_466" class="fnanchor">443</a> cupric sulphide is readily
precipitated even from the ammoniacal solutions (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). It may
<a id="p225" class="xxpn">[p225]</a> easily be shown, in the usual way,<a id="FNanchor_444_467" href="#Footnote_444_467" class="fnanchor">444</a> that the sulphide of copper
is very much less soluble than its phosphate (<em class="italic">exp.</em>).</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Complex Cyanide Ions.</h4>—Metal ions are capable of
forming complex ions, of importance in analytical work, with a
number of components other than ammonia. Among the most
important of these are the complex ions formed with cyanide-ion.
The theory of the complex cyanide ions is entirely analogous
to that of the complex metal-ammonium ions, but there is a
difference in stability that makes their special consideration desirable,
both for practical and for theoretical purposes. The complex
ions of silver-ion and cyanide-ion will be discussed first.</div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Argenticyanide-Ion.</h4>—When potassium cyanide is added
to a solution of silver nitrate, a very insoluble precipitate of
silver cyanide is obtained, but an excess of potassium cyanide
readily redissolves the precipitate (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). Since solution is
effected in spite of the presence of an excess of the precipitating
cyanide-ion, one is led to suspect that the other ion, the silver-ion,
which is needed to form the precipitate, is suppressed by
entering into some kind of complex with the excess of cyanide.
As a matter of fact, the solution contains a salt, potassium argenticyanide
KAg(CN)<sub>2</sub>, in which the silver forms a part of a <em class="italic">negative
argenticyanide-ion</em> (Ag(CN)<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>).<a id="FNanchor_445_468" href="#Footnote_445_468" class="fnanchor">445</a> If a current of electricity
is passed through such a solution, the silver (all but traces),

electrode.<a id="FNanchor_446_469" href="#Footnote_446_469" class="fnanchor">446</a> The complex has been formed, then, by the combination
of a positive silver-ion with two negative cyanide ions,<a id="FNanchor_447_470" href="#Footnote_447_470" class="fnanchor">447</a>
which produce a univalent negative argenticyanide-ion, Ag(CN)<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>.
Recalling the fact that the complex silver-ammonium-ion is not
perfectly stable, one might suspect that the complex cyanide-ion,
in turn, is not absolutely stable, and that the action, by which it is
formed, is balanced, when equilibrium is reached, by a reverse
action of decomposition. We would have, then,
<a id="p226" class="xxpn">[p226]</a> K<sup>+</sup> + Ag<sup>+</sup> + 2 (CN)<sup>−</sup> ⇄ K<sup>+</sup> + [Ag(CN)<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>]

<p class="continue">would hold. Bodlaender<a id="FNanchor_448_471" href="#Footnote_448_471" class="fnanchor">448</a> determined the value of this constant
by measuring the concentrations of the three components under
varying conditions. The value found is 1E−21. The value
of the instability constant for [Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>], of analogous composition,
is 6.8E−8, a very much larger value than the constant
of the [Ag(CN)<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>] complex. The latter is, therefore, by far the
more stable. It must, consequently, be much more difficult to
obtain reactions, such as precipitations, of silver-ion in cyanide
than in ammoniacal solutions. In fact, it is impossible to precipitate
silver chloride by the addition of sodium chloride to KAg(CN)<sub>2</sub>
solution (<em class="italic">exp.</em>).<a id="FNanchor_449_472" href="#Footnote_449_472" class="fnanchor">449</a> Silver sulphide was found to be a much less
<a id="p227" class="xxpn">[p227]</a> soluble salt than the chloride (p. <a href="#p224">224</a>), and ammonium or sodium
sulphide solution, when added to the cyanide solution, readily
precipitates silver sulphide (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). (The sulphide is <em class="italic">capable</em> of
<em class="italic">existence</em> in the solid phase, therefore, under these conditions.)
In view of the extremely small concentrations of silver-ion in
the cyanide solution, we have here a striking illustration of the
extreme insolubility of the sulphide.</p>

<p>According to the equilibrium equation given above, the
larger the excess of cyanide-ion in the solution, the smaller
must be the concentration of silver-ion which is capable of
existence in its presence. In agreement with this conclusion,
we find that the addition of an excess of potassium cyanide
readily redissolves the precipitated silver sulphide
(<em class="italic">exp.</em>).<a id="FNanchor_450_473"
href="#Footnote_450_473" class="fnanchor">450</a> In other words,
even the minute concentration of silver-ion, that must be present
in the supernatant liquid above a precipitate of silver sulphide
([Ag<sup>+</sup>]<sup>2</sup> × [S<sup>2−</sup>] = K<sub>Sol.

present with an excess of potassium cyanide. Consequently, <em
class="italic">the solid phase is incapable of existence in the
system</em>.</p>

<p>The equilibrium equations give us, thus, a comprehensive basis
for the interpretation of the behavior of cyanide solutions containing
silver. First, in accordance with the small value of the
constant, we find it very much more difficult to obtain precipitates
of silver salts in cyanide, than, say, in ammoniacal solutions;
secondly, in accordance with the fact that a very small, but
definite, concentration of the silver-ion may still persist in the
<a id="p228" class="xxpn">[p228]</a> system, we find it possible, in the absence of an excess of cyanide,
to precipitate such an extremely insoluble silver salt as silver sulphide
represents; and finally, in accordance with the form and
constant of our equation, we find it possible, by using an excess of
potassium cyanide, to suppress the silver-ion to the point where
even this extremely insoluble salt can no longer exist.<a id="FNanchor_451_474" href="#Footnote_451_474" class="fnanchor">451</a></p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Cuprocyanide and Cadmicyanide Ions.</h4>—Very many of the
metal ions are capable of forming complexes with cyanide-ion, of
greater or smaller degrees of stability, and, as is the case for the
complex ions formed by metal ions with ammonia, a metal ion is
frequently able to form more than one complex with cyanide-ion.<a id="FNanchor_452_475" href="#Footnote_452_475" class="fnanchor">452</a>
A number of these complex cyanide ions are of particular
interest in qualitative analysis. For instance, we make use of
the difference in the stability of the cuprocyanide and the cadmicyanide
ions as offering us the most convenient method of
recognizing cadmium in the presence of copper. Excepting for
the sulphide and the oxide, cadmium does not form salts and
compounds of characteristic colors, and, except in color, the
salts resemble the corresponding copper salts very much in their
physical and chemical behavior. Copper and cadmium consequently
show the same group reactions in systematic analysis.
The more intense colors of the copper compounds—the black
sulphide, the intensely blue cupric-ammonium-ion—mask the
cadmium reactions. But cupric-ion may be converted, by potassium
cyanide, into a complex ion of extreme stability, from the
solutions of which hydrogen sulphide and alkali sulphides <em class="italic">fail to
precipitate any sulphide of copper, while cadmium sulphide may be
precipitated from the solutions of the much less stable complex
cadmicyanide-ion</em>.</div>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p>When potassium cyanide is added to the deep blue ammoniacal solution
of cupric-ammonium sulphate [Cu(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>]SO<sub>4</sub>, the cupric-ion is reduced<a id="FNanchor_453_476" href="#Footnote_453_476" class="fnanchor">453</a>
<a id="p229" class="xxpn">[p229]</a> to cuprous-ion, and the latter is converted, by an excess of cyanide,
into the extremely stable complex ion Cu(CN)<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup> and its salt,
potassium cuprocyanide K<sub>2</sub>[Cu(CN)<sub>3</sub>]. The instability constant
of the complex ion is: [Cu<sup>+</sup>] × [CN<sup>−</sup>]<sup>3</sup> / [Cu(CN)<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup>] = 0.5E−27,
and the concentration of cuprous-ion, in a 0.1 molar
solution, is approximately<a id="FNanchor_454_477" href="#Footnote_454_477" class="fnanchor">454</a> 3.7E−8. Without an excess
of cyanide, traces of cuprous sulphide may still be precipitated, but
<em class="italic">a few drops excess will prevent the precipitation entirely</em>.<a id="FNanchor_455_478" href="#Footnote_455_478" class="fnanchor">455</a></p>

<p>With an excess of potassium cyanide, cadmium forms the salt
K<sub>2</sub>[Cd(CN)<sub>4</sub>], yielding the ion [Cd(CN)<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>]. The
instability constant<a id="FNanchor_456_479" href="#Footnote_456_479" class="fnanchor">456</a> of the complex ion is
[Cd<sup>2+</sup>] × [CN<sup>−</sup>]<sup>4</sup> / [Cd(CN)<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>] = 1.4E−17. The concentration
of cadmium-ion, in a 0.1 molar solution of the salt, is then
approximately<a id="FNanchor_457_480" href="#Footnote_457_480" class="fnanchor">457</a> 8E−5.</p></div>

<p>If potassium cyanide is added to an ammoniacal solution, containing
both cadmium and copper, until the color of the solution
is just discharged, and if two or three drops excess of the cyanide
is then used, the addition of ammonium sulphide will precipitate
pure cadmium sulphide (<em class="italic">exp.</em>), while ammonium sulphide, added to
a portion of the original ammoniacal solution, will precipitate a
dark mixture of cupric and cadmium sulphide (<em class="italic">exp.</em>), in which the
yellow color of cadmium sulphide is masked by the black precipitate
of cupric sulphide.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Cobalticyanide and Nickelocyanide Ions.</h4>—In much the
same way, in the identification of nickel in the presence of
cobalt, advantage may be taken of the fact that cobalt forms
an extremely stable cobalticyanide<a id="FNanchor_458_481" href="#Footnote_458_481" class="fnanchor">458</a> ion, [Co(CN)<sub>6</sub><sup>3−</sup>], which does
not permit of the precipitation of cobaltic hydroxide, whereas
nickel does not form such an ion, but only forms a not very
stable nickelocyanide ion, [Ni(CN)<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>], which is readily decomposed
by bromine and alkali, nickelic hydroxide being precipitated.
<a id="p230" class="xxpn">[p230]</a> The following are the chief actions involved in the precipitation
of the latter:<a id="FNanchor_459_482" href="#Footnote_459_482" class="fnanchor">459</a></div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Applications and Precautions in Analysis.</h4>—The complex
cyanide ions thus give us a convenient means of <em class="italic">interfering</em> with
the precipitation of certain metal ions, and of enabling us, thereby,
to detect other, closely related, ions in their presence. At the same
time, we must be careful <em class="italic">to identify the ions</em>, which we wish to
suppress, before converting them into these extremely stable
complexes. Potassium cuprocyanide and potassium cobalticyanide
solutions would not give any of the ordinary tests for ions of
copper and cobalt, and to find the latter in such solutions, by these
tests, we would have to take the trouble of destroying the complexes.
Should the destruction of such complexes become necessary
(<em class="italic">e.g.</em> when complex cyanide ions are present in the original
substance under examination), evaporation with sulphuric acid,
with due precautions against inhaling poisonous hydrocyanic acid
fumes, fusion with alkali carbonates, and perhaps most conveniently,
electrolysis with sufficiently high potentials,<a id="FNanchor_460_483" href="#Footnote_460_483" class="fnanchor">460</a> are the methods
most frequently employed for the purpose. It will be recalled
that we have used the method of fusion with potassium carbonate
to find iron in potassium ferrocyanide (p. <a href="#p089">89</a>).</div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Ferrocyanide and Ferricyanide Ions.</h4>—The ferro- and ferricyanide
ions may also be treated as complex ions. For instance,
for the ferricyanide-ion, we would expect a condition of equilibrium
to exist between the complex ion and the simple ions according to:</div>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
<span class="ibnowrap">

</span></div></div>

<div class="xxpn"><a id="p231" class="xxpn">[p231]</a></div>

<p>If the fact is recalled that the extremely sensitive tests for the
ferric-ion fail to reveal the least trace of it in a potassium ferricyanide
solution, one must conclude that the ferricyanide-ion must
be extremely stable. The conception of the ferricyanide-ion as a
complex ion, subject to the above equilibrium conditions, suggests
that if a considerable excess of hydrogen-ion is added to its solutions,
the concentration of ferric-ion must be increased: since
hydrocyanic acid is an extremely weak acid (p. <a href="#p104">104</a>), the ratio
[H<sup>+</sup>] × [CN<sup>−</sup>] / [HCN] having the value 7 / 10<sup>10</sup>, the addition of
some concentrated hydrochloric acid must decidedly suppress the
cyanide-ion in a ferricyanide solution and thus lead to an increase in
the concentration of the ferric-ion. Under these conditions, direct
evidence of the presence of the ferric-ion, and of the fact that the
complex ion is a component in a reversible reaction, may, indeed,
be obtained, as well as further evidence of the extreme stability
of the complex. The presence of traces of ferric-ion may be
detected, namely, in the acid solution by the thiocyanate test,
applied in its most sensitive form, in which any ferrithiocyanate
produced is taken up in ether.</p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p><em class="smcap">Exp.</em> Potassium ferricyanide, treated with a thiocyanate and ether, does
not show the least trace of color; when some concentrated hydrochloric acid
is added to the mixture, a perfectly plain, although noticeably faint, pink tint
is imparted to the ether solution.</p>

<p>Mercuric cyanide, as we have seen (p. <a href="#p115">115</a>), is exceptional in its exceedingly
small capacity for ionization. Sherrill<a id="FNanchor_461_484" href="#Footnote_461_484" class="fnanchor">461</a> has found that the dissociation constant
for [Hg<sup>2+</sup>] × [CN<sup>−</sup>]<sup>4</sup> / [Hg(CN)<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>] has the extremely small value
0.4E−41. Consequently, mercuric-ion must be even more effective than hydrogen-ion
(strong acids), in suppressing the cyanide-ion and liberating the ferrous-
or ferric-ion, in solutions of ferrocyanides or ferricyanides. In fact, when a
solution of potassium ferrocyanide is warmed, for a moment, with some
mercuric oxide, the ferrocyanide complex is to some extent decomposed; the
liberated ferrous-ion is oxidized, by the excess of mercuric oxide,<a id="FNanchor_462_485" href="#Footnote_462_485" class="fnanchor">462</a> to ferric-ion,
and the presence of the latter, in quantity, is shown by the abundant precipitation
of ferric ferrocyanide or Prussian blue, when the mixture is acidified
with hydrochloric acid (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). <a id="p232" class="xxpn">[p232]</a></p></div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Aurocyanide-Ion.</h4>—Gold forms a particularly stable complex ion
with cyanide-ion. The constant<a id="FNanchor_463_486" href="#Footnote_463_486" class="fnanchor">463</a> for the ratio [Au<sup>+</sup>] × [CN<sup>−</sup>]<sup>2</sup> / [Au(CN)<sup>−</sup><sub>2</sub>]
has the value 10<sup>−28</sup>. This makes potassium cyanide an excellent solvent for
insoluble gold compounds, such as gold sulphide, and the cyanide process for
the extraction of gold ores makes use of this property.</div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Reacting Components in Solutions of the Complex Cyanide Ions.</h4>—The
extraordinary values, obtained for the constants expressing the condition
of equilibrium between cyanide ions and some of the simple metal
ions, such as gold and silver ions, and their complex ions, have led to inquiries
concerning a question of fundamental interest in the theory of complex ions
and in the theory of ionization itself. In a 0.05 molar solution of KAg(CN)<sub>2</sub>,
containing an excess of 0.1 mole of CN<sup>−</sup>, per liter, the concentration of silver-ion
is only 5E−21. And yet, the addition of potassium hydrosulphide
(sufficient to make [KSH] = 0.1 molar) will precipitate silver sulphide practically
instantaneously from the solution.<a id="FNanchor_464_487" href="#Footnote_464_487" class="fnanchor">464</a> In solutions containing a larger
excess of cyanide, the concentration of the silver-ion is enormously reduced,
and yet, while we can no longer precipitate silver sulphide from such a solution,
metallic silver may be precipitated by zinc or by the action of an electric
potential at the cathode (Chapter XV). The question may be asked, <em class="italic">whether
we must consider that in these actions the minute quantity of free silver ions,
present at any moment, is alone capable of the reactions</em> indicated, and that the
<em class="italic">decomposition of the complex</em> into its <em class="italic">components</em>—as one of these, the silver-ion,
is removed by precipitation—takes place with <em class="italic">sufficient speed</em> to account
for the <em class="italic">rapid actions, wholly, as direct actions of the silver ions</em>. The alternative
to an affirmative answer to this question is, that silver sulphide or silver <em class="italic">may
be precipitated by direct action of the precipitant</em> on the <em class="italic">complex</em> ions, rather
than on the <em class="italic">silver ions</em>. We may indicate the first course suggested for the
action, as follows:</div>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="EquationWLable">
<div class="ibnowrap">2 Ag(CN)<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> + S<sup>2−</sup> ⇄
<br />4 CN<sup>−</sup> + 2 Ag<sup>+</sup> + S<sup>2−</sup> ⇄ Ag<sub>2</sub>S ↓ + 4 CN<sup>−</sup>.
</div></div>
<div class="equationlabel">I</div>
</div>

<p class="continue">The second, suggested, course of the action would be the following:</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="EquationWLable">
2 Ag(CN)<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> + S<sup>2−</sup> ⇄ Ag<sub>2</sub>S ↓ + 4 CN<sup>−</sup>.
</div>
<div class="equationlabel">II</div>
</div>

<p class="continue">This second action would mean that we could obtain reactions of silver ions,
such as the precipitation of silver sulphide, <em class="italic">without the intermediate formation
of the free ions themselves</em>.</p>

<p>The consequences of the first, the ordinary, conception of such actions
<em class="italic">as direct actions of silver ions</em>, have been analyzed by
Haber<a id="FNanchor_465_488" href="#Footnote_465_488" class="fnanchor">465</a> from the point
of view of the velocities of the actions, by which the complex must be formed
from its components and be decomposed into them, in order to satisfy the
facts concerning the precipitations. <a id="p233" class="xxpn">[p233]</a></p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p>We may consider, with Haber, a liter of a 0.05 molar solution of K<sub>2</sub>Ag(CN)<sub>3</sub>,
containing an
excess<a id="FNanchor_466_489" href="#Footnote_466_489" class="fnanchor">466</a>
of 0.95 mole potassium cyanide. In such a solution, the
concentration of silver-ion is reduced to 8E−24 gram-ion per liter. Now,
according to the best determinations of the ultimate dimensions of molecules,
about 10<sup>24</sup> molecules are estimated to be contained in a mole (gram-molecule),
and 10<sup>24</sup> ions, therefore, in a gram-ion (<em class="italic">e.g.</em> in 108 grams of silver-ion there
would be 10<sup>24</sup> individual silver ions). Then a liter of the solution we are
considering would contain, at any moment, only eight individual silver ions,
which are different ones from moment to moment, since the reversible reactions
Ag<sup>+</sup> + 3 CN<sup>−</sup> ⇄ Ag(CN)<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup>, are going on continually. Thus 100 c.c.
of the solution would not contain even one silver ion all the time, but the
requirements of the equilibrium conditions could be
met<a id="FNanchor_467_490" href="#Footnote_467_490" class="fnanchor">467</a> by silver ions
"flashing up and disappearing" in such a way, that the required average
concentration in unit time is maintained. There is nothing irrational in such
a conception.</p>

<p>One may ask, however, what must be the velocities, with which the complex
is formed from the components, and is resolved into them, in order to
satisfy an instability constant<a href="#Footnote_466_489" class="fnanchor">466</a>
10<sup>−22</sup> and still enable us to obtain a practically
instantaneous precipitation, say of silver sulphide, the action being analyzed
on the basis of the ordinary conception that only the silver-ion itself, and
not the complex ion, is directly active in the formation of the silver sulphide.
A condition of equilibrium, in a reversible action, implies that the velocities
of the two continuous, opposed reactions are equal (p. <a href="#p094">94</a>). For the action
Ag<sup>+</sup> + 3 CN<sup>−</sup> → Ag(CN)<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup> the <em class="italic">velocity</em> of <em class="italic">formation</em> of the <em class="italic">complex</em> is
proportional to a characteristic constant, K<sub>Formation</sub>, to the concentration,
[Ag<sup>+</sup>], of the silver-ion, and to the third power (see p. <a href="#p094">94</a>) of the concentration,
[CN<sup>−</sup>], of the cyanide-ion. The <em class="italic">velocity</em> of the <em class="italic">opposed reaction</em>
of <em class="italic">decomposition</em> of the complex is proportional to another characteristic
constant, K<sub>Decomposition</sub>, and to the concentration, [Ag(CN)<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup>], of the complex
ion. For the condition of equilibrium, the velocities of the opposed reactions
are equal, and we derive the relation:</p>

<p class="continue">The equilibrium constant of the complex ion is, then, the ratio of the velocity

the cyanide-ion and the complex ion are maintained at 1, the formation of the
complex takes place 10<sup>22</sup> times as slowly as when [Ag<sup>+</sup>] = 1, and a condition of

then, according to Haber, a molar solution of potassium argenticyanide
would not be able to form in thousands of years sufficient silver ions to be
discovered by any direct test, a result which is not compatible with the
precipitation of silver sulphide and of metallic silver in a few minutes, since
silver ions could not be <em class="italic">supplied rapidly enough</em>. It is evident, thus, that the
ratio 1 / 10<sup>22</sup> must indicate an exceedingly small value for T<sub>Formation</sub>, if only
silver ions form silver sulphide and silver.</p>

<p>If we assume that the complex is decomposed so fast as to supply new
silver ions rapidly enough, to allow us to consider the precipitation of silver
and silver sulphide as direct actions of the silver ions, then we may, conservatively,
consider T<sub>Decomposition</sub> to be about 1 / 100 second. Then T<sub>Formation</sub>
would be only 1 / 10<sup>24</sup> second. Considering the limiting results for the dimensions
of atoms (and ions) and taking account of the fact that the formation of
the complex <em class="italic">involves electrical changes</em>, that is, in modern terms, changes in position
of electrons,<a id="FNanchor_470_493" href="#Footnote_470_493" class="fnanchor">470</a> Haber finds, that to satisfy the above value for the time
constant, such changes must involve a motion of electrical charges at a speed
about a million times as great as the velocity of light. Such a velocity is,
unquestionably, incompatible with our knowledge of the velocities of light
and of electrical charges. We must draw the conclusion that <em class="italic">the complex
argenticyanide-ion probably cannot decompose fast enough into its ions</em>, to enable
the latter to be the <em class="italic">only</em> components which make it possible to precipitate

greater concentrations of the reacting components, <em class="italic">e.g.</em> of the complex
ion; the first one would, probably, be found to have the advantage of an enormously
greater velocity constant. The actual velocities of the two reactions
have never been measured<a id="FNanchor_472_495" href="#Footnote_472_495" class="fnanchor">472</a> and no final explanation of the relations can be
offered. The problem is a very important one, involving the whole question
of the mode of ionic action (<em class="italic">cf.</em> Chap. V, especially p. <a href="#p083">83</a>).</p>

<p>Aside from the theoretical value of the problem that has been raised, the
question of immediate moment to us, from the point of view of analytical
chemistry, is the question whether such conclusions would invalidate, in any
way, the use we have made of the theory of complex ions, in elucidating the
question of the precipitation and nonprecipitation of salts of simple ions from
solutions of their complex ions.</p>

<p>The existence of a precipitate in contact with a solution is a question of
a <em class="italic">condition</em> of <em class="italic">equilibrium</em>; the question raised, as the result of Haber's calculations,
deals simply with the <em class="italic">problem of the path, the mechanism by which
equilibrium is reached</em>, but the answer to it <em class="italic">does not affect the conditions, on which
the maintenance of equilibrium depends</em>. All the conclusions, drawn in our
discussions of precipitation from solutions of complex ions, are concerned with
<em class="italic">final conditions for equilibrium</em>, <em class="italic">i.e.</em> with the conditions under which a <em class="italic">precipitate
can exist</em>, and not with the mechanism of its formation. The conclusions
reached are valid, therefore, irrespective of what the decision may ultimately
be in the question, whether the simple ions alone are acted upon, when their
salts are precipitated, or whether the complex ions are also immediately concerned
in the action. The precipitation of silver chloride from an ammoniacal
solution<a id="FNanchor_473_496" href="#Footnote_473_496" class="fnanchor">473</a> may serve to illustrate this point.</p>

<p>In the first place, the precipitation of silver chloride from an ammoniacal
solution, say by sodium chloride, may be considered to be the result of the
direct interaction of chloride ions with the small quantity of silver ions present,
<em class="italic">the complex serving only to renew the supply of silver ions</em>, as the latter are
removed from solution, by the precipitation. The course of the action would
be expressed by the equations</p>

<p>When the precipitation is ended and equilibrium established,
a trace of silver chloride is in solution, in contact with the
precipitate, and, according <a id="p236" class="xxpn">[p236]</a>
to the principle of the solubility-product, we must have
[Ag<sup>+</sup>] × [Cl<sup>−</sup>] = K<sub>AgCl</sub>. Bodländer's
experiments,<a id="FNanchor_474_497" href="#Footnote_474_497"
class="fnanchor">474</a> on the solubility of silver chloride in
ammonia, prove that this relation is in perfect agreement with
the facts. For the silver-ammonium-ion, the free ammonia and the
silver-ion present in the solution, we must have the relation
[Ag<sup>+</sup>] × [NH<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2</sup> / [Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>] = K<sub>Instab. Const.</sub>.
This relation, according to the experimental evidence, is also found
to hold.</p>

<p>Now, we might, on the other hand, assume that the primary or main
action, leading to the precipitation of silver chloride, is the
interaction of the chloride ions <em class="italic">with the complex
ions</em>, rather than with silver ions. Silver-ammonium chloride,
[Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]Cl, might first be formed, for
instance, and then decompose <em class="italic">directly</em> into
silver chloride and ammonia. This is the simplest assumption we can
make for this kind of action and is sufficiently illustrative of any
kind of direct action between the chloride ions and the complex ions.
The path of the action would then be expressed by the equations</p>

<p>It is clear, from a comparison of this series of equations with equations
(1), that they represent the same reversible reactions in a somewhat different
order. <em class="italic">Since equilibrium conditions for any reversible reaction</em> (<em class="italic">e.g.</em> for
A + B ⇄ C + D) <em class="italic">are independent of the order in which the components</em> (<em class="italic">e.g.</em>
A, B, C, D) <em class="italic">are brought into the system</em> (p. <a href="#p094">94</a>), the difference of order, indicated
by equations (1) and (2), cannot affect the final condition of equilibrium
in the system under discussion. For instance, since we again have
silver chloride in contact with its saturated solution, we again must have
[Ag<sup>+</sup>] × [Cl<sup>−</sup>] = K<sub>AgCl</sub>, and <em class="italic">the experimental confirmation</em> of this relation (and
similarly of the relation [Ag<sup>+</sup>] × [NH<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2</sup> / [Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>] = K) <em class="italic">agrees as well
with this second path of the action as with the first</em>. Conversely, since the path,
by which the equilibrium is reached, does not affect the condition of equilibrium,
it is perfectly legitimate to draw conclusions from equilibrium constants,
<em class="italic">without assuming to know anything at all about the path by which the condition
is reached</em>.<a id="FNanchor_475_498" href="#Footnote_475_498" class="fnanchor">475</a></p>

<p>For analytical work, the vital point is the <em class="italic">ultimate condition of equilibrium,
which determines whether a precipitate may exist and be formed in a given system
or not</em>. The instability constants of the complex ions and the solubility-product
constants of precipitates are the constant factors involved in the
ultimate conditions for equilibrium, and they do not depend on the path by
which equilibrium is reached. Consequently, we find that the application of
<a id="p237" class="xxpn">[p237]</a> the theory of complex ions to analytical problems of precipitation has been in
no wise invalidated by the problems presented by Haber. The theory forms
now, as before, in fact, the best quantitative basis for the expression of the
experimental results. The stability constants, and the concentrations of the
components used, determine the limiting concentrations in which a given metal
ion is capable of continued existence, and determine, therefore, the question
whether an ionogen, of a given solubility, is capable of existence as a solid
phase in a given system.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Structure of Complex Ions.</h4>—The ability of ammonia to
form complex ions with simple metal ions is commonly ascribed to the
unsaturated condition of ammonia (see p. <a href="#p065">65</a>). It is interesting to
recall the fact, that the marked power of the cyanide-ion to form
complexes of extraordinary stability, is also associated with a
similarly unsaturated condition of the cyanide-ion (p. <a href="#p066">66</a>). According
to the results of Nef's researches,<a id="FNanchor_476_499" href="#Footnote_476_499" class="fnanchor">476</a> we have, in hydrocyanic acid
and the cyanides, unsaturated or bivalent carbon; potassium cyanide,
for instance, has the structure <span class="ibnowrap">K─N═C&lt;.</span> The
two free valences of the carbon atom may, according to the electrical
theory of valence, be again considered to consist of one negative and
one positive charge. The possibility of the formation of complexes
is then self-evident, and we can readily see, how silver cyanide,
Ag─N═C±, should absorb cyanide-ion,<a id="FNanchor_477_500" href="#Footnote_477_500" class="fnanchor">477</a> ∓C═N<sup>−</sup>,
and form a complex (Ag─N═C═C═N<sup>−</sup>) or Ag(CN)<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>, whose
potassium salt would be potassium argenticyanide, K[Ag(CN)<sub>2</sub>]. For
the potassium salt K<sub>2</sub>Ag(CN)<sub>3</sub>, of the second complex ion<a id="FNanchor_478_501" href="#Footnote_478_501" class="fnanchor">478</a>

<p>The other complex cyanide ions, ferrocyanide, ferricyanide,

entirely similar to those given to the argenticyanide
ions.<a id="FNanchor_479_502" href="#Footnote_479_502"

<div class="h4p"><h4>Complex Halide, Sulphide, Oxide and Oxonium
Ions.</h4>—In conclusion, there are other elements besides nitrogen
(in ammonia and its derivatives) and carbon (in cyanides), which
form complex ions with simple ions; notably the halogens form such
complexes. Chloroplatinic acid, H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub>,
and its salts (Lab. Manual, <em class="italic">q. v.</em>),
fluorosilicic acid, H<sub>2</sub>SiF<sub>6</sub>, potassium-mercuric
iodide, <a id="p238" class="xxpn">[p238]</a> KHgI<sub>3</sub>
and K<sub>2</sub>HgI<sub>4</sub>,<a id="FNanchor_480_503"

forms a most sensitive reagent for the detection of traces
of ammonia,<a id="FNanchor_481_504" href="#Footnote_481_504"
class="fnanchor">481</a> are instances of complexes of the
halogens that are of importance in analysis. It is worthy of
note that the most likely structure<a id="FNanchor_482_505"
href="#Footnote_482_505" class="fnanchor">482</a>
for these compounds, <em class="italic">e.g.</em>
Cl<sub>2</sub>═Pt═(Cl═Cl─H)<sub>2</sub>, bears a very striking
analogy to the structures frequently assigned to the cyanide and
ammonia complex ions. Oxygen and sulphur form complex ions, of
great stability, with many elements, and we shall presently have
occasion to discuss in detail some of the complex ions formed by
sulphur. All of the oxygen acids may be treated as containing
complex ions of oxygen and some other element, and their instability
constants<a id="FNanchor_483_506" href="#Footnote_483_506"
class="fnanchor">483</a> are factors in determining their chemical
behavior. For instance, such is the case, most likely, for their
behavior as oxidizing and reducing agents (see Chapter XVI). The
unsaturated condition of oxygen in water, (H<sub>2</sub>O±),
makes possible, also, the formation of complex ions,
[(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub><em class="italic">x</em></sub>Me]<sup>+</sup>,
etc., called oxonium ions and comparable with metal-ammonium
ions. They form a most inviting field for rigorous investigation.
It is altogether probable that the hydrogen-ion is intimately
related, in aqueous acid solutions, to the complex oxonium-ion,
[(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub><em class="italic">x</em></sub>H]<sup>+</sup>,
comparable with the ammonium-ion, (NH<sub>3</sub>H)<sup>+</sup>, and,
possibly, the greater part of the hydrogen-ion, in aqueous solutions,
exists in this form of combination.<a id="FNanchor_484_507"
href="#Footnote_484_507" class="fnanchor">484</a></div></div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Complex Ions of Organic Oxygen
Derivatives.</h4>—A further group of complex ions, derived from
organic derivatives of oxygen, are of particular importance in
analytical work. Many organic compounds, such as sugars, glycerine,
tartrates, citrates, interfere, more or less, with the precipitation
of metal hydroxides and certain of their salts. For instance,
the addition of cane sugar or of rochelle salt (sodium potassium
tartrate) to a solution of <a id="p239" class="xxpn">[p239]</a>
cupric sulphate prevents the subsequent precipitation of cupric
hydroxide by alkali (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). In place of a
precipitate of the hydroxide, a clear, intensely blue, solution
is formed. In an analogous way, the same substances and similar
compounds interfere with the precipitation of the hydroxides of
aluminium and chromium, and since aluminium and chromium should be
precipitated as hydroxides in systematic analysis (Chap. X), the
presence of such organic compounds must be most carefully considered,
to avoid error.<a id="FNanchor_485_508" href="#Footnote_485_508"
class="fnanchor">485</a> The precipitation of moderately difficultly
soluble salts, such as phosphates, is also rendered, appreciably,
more difficult. Only extremely insoluble salts, such as the
sulphides of the arsenic, copper and zinc groups, are precipitated,
from solutions of organic substances of the character indicated,
without any appreciable interference.<a id="FNanchor_486_509"
href="#Footnote_486_509" class="fnanchor">486</a></div>

<p>These relations clearly recall the characteristic behavior of
ammoniacal and cyanide solutions, in which complex ions are formed,
and the interference of the organic compounds with precipitation
is of a similar nature—complex ions are formed by metal ions with
these organic compounds, and the complexes are, in many instances,
sufficiently stable to reduce the concentrations of the metal ions
to the point, where only very difficultly soluble salts can be
precipitated.</p>

<p>The relations may be illustrated by the discussion
of the complex formed by the cupric-ion with tartrates.
The structure of sodium tartrate is expressed by
NaO<sub>2</sub>C─CH(<em class="uscore">OH</em>)─CH(<em class="uscore">OH</em>)─CO<sub>2</sub>Na. The underscored
hydroxide groups <em class="uscore">OH</em> are known in organic chemistry as <em
class="italic">alcohol groups</em>.<a id="FNanchor_487_510"
href="#Footnote_487_510" class="fnanchor">487</a> Now,
alcohols resemble water in very many properties and, among
others, in the capacity to form metal derivatives or <em
class="italic">alcoholates</em>, in which the hydrogen (ion) of
the hydroxide group is replaced by metal ions. The alcoholates
correspond, thus, to the metal hydroxides, which are the analogous
<a id="p240" class="xxpn">[p240]</a> derivatives of water. Exactly
as there is a vast difference in the readiness with which the various
metal hydroxides, or bases, ionize, many of them being only slightly
ionizable (the weakest bases), so certain alcoholates are much less
readily ionizable than others. The alkali alcoholates are most
readily ionized.</p>

<p>When sodium tartrate is mixed with an excess of sodium hydroxide,
some of the <em class="italic">readily ionizable</em> sodium salt of
the <em class="italic">alcohol</em> groups of the sodium tartrate is
formed and we have:</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
(CHONa)<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>)<sub>2</sub> + 2 Na<sup>+</sup> ⇄ (CHO<sup>−</sup>)<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>)<sub>2</sub> + 4 Na<sup>+</sup>.
</div></div>

<p class="continue">When cupric sulphate is added to this mixture, a <em class="italic">slightly ionizable
complex cupri-tartrate-ion</em> is formed by the union of the cupric-ion
with the "alcoholate-tartrate-ion":</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
(CHO<sup>−</sup>)<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>)<sub>2</sub> + Cu<sup>2+</sup> ⥂ [(CHO)<sub>2</sub>Cu](CO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>)<sub>2</sub>.
</div></div>

<p>The complex ion is not perfectly stable and so the action is a
reversible one, as indicated in the equation. The greater portion
of the copper, however, is present <em class="italic">as part of the complex negative
ion</em> of cupric-tartaric acid and its salts. This may be demonstrated
by subjecting the solution to electrolysis in a U-tube
(p. <a href="#p045">45</a>). It is readily seen (<em class="italic">exp.</em>) that <em class="italic">a deep blue ion</em>, obviously
containing copper, <em class="italic">migrates to the positive pole</em>.<a id="FNanchor_488_511" href="#Footnote_488_511" class="fnanchor">488</a> The concentration
of cupric-ion is so small that its hydroxide and its phosphate
are not precipitated from the solution by the addition, respectively,
of alkali or of a soluble phosphate (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). Cupric sulphide, however,
is so insoluble that it may be precipitated completely from
the solution by the addition of a sulphide (<em class="italic">exp.</em>), the concentration
of cupric-ion being much smaller in the saturated solution of
the sulphide than in the solution of sodium cupri-tartrate.</p>

<p>Citrates, sugars, glycerine, contain alcoholic groups of the
same nature as found in the tartrates, and they are capable of
forming similar complexes, or little ionizable <em class="italic">alcoholates</em>, with
metal ions.</p>

<p>Certain organic acids, which contain no alcohol groups,<a id="FNanchor_489_512" href="#Footnote_489_512" class="fnanchor">489</a> are
<a id="p241" class="xxpn">[p241]</a> also capable of forming fairly stable complexes with metal ions:
thus, acetates form a complex with lead-ion, that is sufficiently
stable to render lead sulphate, which is difficultly soluble in water,
readily soluble in ammonium acetate solution<a id="FNanchor_490_513" href="#Footnote_490_513" class="fnanchor">490</a> (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). Soluble
oxalates readily combine with ferric, ferrous, cupric and other
oxalates and interfere, more or less, with the detection of the metal
ions, as the result of complex formations.</p>

<p>All of these complexes are <em class="italic">decomposed</em> rather readily <em class="italic">by the
addition of strong acids</em>, whose hydrogen-ion breaks up the complex
ions, by suppressing the anions<a id="FNanchor_491_514" href="#Footnote_491_514" class="fnanchor">491</a> of the much weaker organic
acids and alcohols. Consequently, these organic compounds do
not interfere with tests which may be carried out in strongly
acid solution. For instance, the addition of potassium ferrocyanide
to a solution of ammonium ferrioxalate (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Fe(C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>,
to which an excess of ammonium oxalate has been added, gives only
a slight indication of the presence of ferric-ion (a greenish blue
solution is obtained); when hydrochloric acid, in excess, is added
to the mixture, Prussian blue, ferric ferrocyanide, is immediately
precipitated in quantity (<em class="italic">exp.</em>).</p>

The naming of the complex ions, which ammonia
forms with metal ions, has not yet been satisfactorily settled.
English writers frequently speak of "ammonio-argentic" ion and
"ammonio-argentic" nitrate. German writers speak of "Silber-ammoniak"
ion (Abegg, <em class="italic">Handb. der anorg. Chem.</em>, II, 728), which would
read "silver-ammon<em class="italic">ia</em>" ion in English terms. The terminology
"silver-ammoni<em class="italic">um</em>" ion, used in this book, is based on the idea,
that all these complex ions are essentially <em class="italic">of the same nature</em>
as the well-known <em class="italic">ammonium-ion</em>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, the positive charge
being, almost certainly, carried by <em class="italic">nitrogen</em> in these complex ions,
as it is in ammonium-ion. The latter is a <em class="italic">complex ion of ammonia</em>
with <em class="italic">hydrogen</em>-ion. The name "ammonio-argentic" ion does not bring
out this close relationship and puts the emphasis on the silver,
which is probably little concerned in the reactions of the complex
as such. The names "silver-ammon<em class="italic">ia</em>" ion and "silver-ammon<em class="italic">ia</em>"
nitrate sound badly and do not emphasize the relation to ammoni<em class="italic">um</em>,
potassi<em class="italic">um</em>, sodi<em class="italic">um</em> and similar positive ions and their salts.
The term "<em class="italic">ammonium</em>" is, for the reasons given, used here in a
<em class="italic">generic</em> sense for all complex ions of ammonia with simple metal
ions (such as H<sup>+</sup>, Ag<sup>+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup> etc.), and the number
of ammonia molecules, entering into the composition of a complex
ion, is not indicated in the names. A similar nomenclature has long
been in vogue, and has worked well, for the complex ions of metal
ions with the cyanide-ion (see below). We speak of ferro<em class="italic">cyanide</em>,
Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub><sup>4−</sup>, argenti<em class="italic">cyanide</em>, Ag(CN)<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> and
Ag<sub>2</sub>(CN)<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup>, etc., without indicating the number of cyanide
groups, CN, in the complex, and we use the same generic <em class="italic">ending</em>
"cyanide" as is used to designate the simple cyanide ion, <em class="italic">e.g.</em>
to designate the ion formed from potassium cyanide, KCN ⇄ K<sup>+</sup> +

be K<sub>S.P.</sub> / [Cl<sup>−</sup>] = 2E−10 gram-ion. Neglecting
the fact that the complex salt is not completely ionized and
putting [Ag(CN)<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>] = 0.05, and calling <em

necessary to prevent the precipitation of the chloride, we have: </p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">

</div></div>

<p class="continue">
We find <em class="italic">x</em> = 5E−7 mole, or approximately 0.03 milligram potassium
cyanide (cyanide-ion) per liter. This minute quantity of free
cyanide, if not originally present in the solution used, would be
formed by the liberation of potassium cyanide from the complex
(according to KAg(CN)<sub>2</sub> + KCl → AgCl + 2 KCN) as soon as 2.5E−7
mole, or 0.036 milligram, of silver chloride per liter have been
formed, a quantity too small to be perceptible.
</p>
<p>
When potassium cyanide is added to a silver nitrate solution,
the precipitate formed is found to be silver argenticyanide,
Ag[Ag(CN)<sub>2</sub>], the silver salt of the extremely stable complex,
rather than the simple salt, silver cyanide, AgCN [<em class="italic">cf.</em> Bodländer,
<em class="italic">Z. anorg. Chem.</em>, <em class="bold">39</em>, 223 (1904)]. Ag[Ag(CN)<sub>2</sub>] is
even less soluble than silver chloride, the solubility-product
constant for [Ag<sup>+</sup>] × [Ag(CN)<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>] being 2.25E−12. An excess
of only 2E−6 mole, or about 0.15 milligram, of potassium cyanide
(cyanide-ion) per liter is sufficient to prevent the precipitation of
silver cyanide (silver
argenticyanide) from a 0.1 molar solution of KAg(CN)<sub>2</sub>, and, conversely, at
least this minute excess of potassium cyanide is used in the preparation of a
clear 0.1 molar solution of KAg(CN)<sub>2</sub>, by the addition of potassium cyanide
to silver nitrate, until the silver cyanide, first precipitated, is just redissolved
(Bodländer, <em class="italic">loc. cit.</em>). This excess, as just explained, is more than sufficient
to prevent the precipitation of silver chloride from the cyanide solution,
even by a large excess of potassium or sodium chloride. Unless one takes into
account, in the manner indicated, this marked influence of a minute excess
of cyanide-ion in decidedly reducing the concentration of silver-ion in these
solutions, one could be led, wrongly, to infer from the value of the instability
constant of the complex ion and that of the solubility-product constant
of silver chloride, that silver chloride should still be precipitated by the
addition of sodium chloride to a solution of KAg(CN)<sub>2</sub>.</p></div>

The most common organic acids contain the acid group
—CO(<em class="uscore">OH</em>), as in acetic acid, CH<sub>3</sub>CO(<em class="uscore">OH</em>). The hydroxide group
<em class="uscore">OH</em> of the alcohols, <em class="italic">e.g.</em> in CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>(<em class="uscore">OH</em>), is still found
in these organic acids, but its tendency to form hydrogen-ion is
very much increased by the replacement of two hydrogen atoms of the
alcohols by the oxygen atom, as found in the acids. To a
certain degree, the properties of the alcohol hydroxide are maintained in the
properties shown by the acid hydroxide group. Thus, the organic acids, on
the whole, are still rather weak acids, and their salts, in many instances, are
appreciably less ionizable than the salts of strong inorganic acids. The
organic acids, further, may combine, to a certain extent, with water and thus
form hydrates (<em class="italic">e.g.</em> CH<sub>3</sub>COOH + H<sub>2</sub>O ⇄ CH<sub>3</sub>C(OH)<sub>3</sub>) containing a number
of hydroxide groups: the second and third hydroxide groups must have a
very much smaller tendency to form hydrogen ions and ionizable salts, than
has the first hydroxide group (p. <a href="#p102">102</a>), and the former, thus show, more
nearly, the behavior of alcoholic hydroxide groups. Finally, organic acids also
show a tendency to combine with themselves, forming complex acids (<em class="italic">e.g.</em>,
(CH<sub>3</sub>COOH)<sub>2</sub> or CH<sub>3</sub>C(OH)<sub>2</sub>OOCCH<sub>3</sub>), from which complex salts may be
derived, which may be little ionizable. The power of the organic acids to
form complex ions—which they share with many inorganic acids—is most
likely intimately connected with the relations described.</p></div>

<p>The analytical groups, which we have heretofore discussed,
contain elements, whose oxides are preëminently <em class="italic">base-forming</em>.
The methods of separation of these groups, from each other,
involve, primarily, physical<a id="FNanchor_492_515" href="#Footnote_492_515" class="fnanchor">492</a> differences between the groups—in
the matter of the relative insolubility of analogous salts. Thus,
barium, strontium and calcium carbonates are precipitated, and
separated from the alkalies, by means of ammonium carbonate, not
because the alkalies do not form carbonates when their salts, in
solution, are treated with ammonium carbonate, but wholly
because barium, strontium and calcium carbonates are very
difficultly, the alkali carbonates easily, soluble in water. The
hydroxides of the aluminium group and the sulphides of the
zinc group are less soluble than the hydroxides and sulphides of
the alkaline earths and alkalies. The sulphides of the copper and
the arsenic groups, again, are still less soluble than the sulphides
of the zinc group, and thus the former may be precipitated by
hydrogen sulphide, even when its precipitating power is reduced
by the suppression of its sulphide (and hydrosulphide) ions by the
addition of a strong acid.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the separation of the arsenic group (arsenic,
antimony, tin, gold and platinum) from the copper group, with
which it is precipitated by hydrogen sulphide from acid solutions,
depends, essentially, on a <em class="italic">chemical</em> difference between the groups.
The oxides, especially the <em class="italic">higher</em> oxides, of the arsenic group, are
preëminently <em class="italic">acid</em>-forming; the higher oxides form such acids
as arsenic acid, H<sub>3</sub>AsO<sub>4</sub>, antimonic acid, H<sub>3</sub>SbO<sub>4</sub>, stannic acid,
H<sub>2</sub>SnO<sub>3</sub>, platinic acid, H<sub>2</sub>PtO<sub>3</sub>, and auric acid, HAuO<sub>2</sub>. These
<a id="p243" class="xxpn">[p243]</a> hydroxides are, however, all more or less <em class="italic">weakly basic</em> in character
<em class="italic">as well</em>. The hydroxides of the lower oxides of the metals are,
as one must expect, much more strongly basic, but most of them—arsenious,
antimonous and stannous hydroxides—still show
sufficient acid character to be distinctly amphoteric in behavior.
But, with the exception of arsenious acid, the basic ionization of
the hydroxides of the lower oxides is more pronounced than their
acid ionization.</p>

<p>The basic ionization of the hydroxides of their lower and higher
oxides brings these elements into the plan of analysis for the metal
or positive ions in systematic analysis. In the presence of hydrochloric
acid they form chlorides, which yield positive ions in sufficient
quantity<a id="FNanchor_493_516" href="#Footnote_493_516" class="fnanchor">493</a> to allow their extremely insoluble sulphides to be
precipitated by hydrogen sulphide in acid solution, together with
the, likewise, very insoluble sulphides of the copper group.</p>

<p>The acid-forming properties of the oxides of the arsenic group
are maintained in their sulphides. Again, this is especially evident
in the <em class="italic">higher</em> sulphides. The element sulphur is substituted for
the closely related element oxygen without any profound change
in the chemical behavior of the compounds. Advantage is taken
of this acid-forming power to separate the sulphides of the arsenic
group from the sulphides of the copper group, which either are
not acid-forming at all, or exhibit this property only to a very
slight degree.<a id="FNanchor_494_517" href="#Footnote_494_517" class="fnanchor">494</a></p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Sulpho-Salts.</h4>—The similarity in the behavior of oxygen
and sulphur derivatives, in this respect, is general and is not
restricted to the metal sulphides we are discussing. For instance,
the acid-forming power of carbon dioxide is shown also by carbon
disulphide, the corresponding sulphur derivative of carbon. Just as
the former combines with potassium hydroxide to form a carbonate,
so carbon disulphide dissolves in solutions of potassium hydrosulphide
and potassium sulphide to form potassium sulpho-carbonate:</div>

</div></div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Sulpho-Acids.</h4>—The free <em class="italic">sulpho-acids</em> are liberated, from their
salts, by any stronger acid, such as hydrochloric acid; the acids
are extremely unstable and revert rapidly to the sulphides, from
which their salts were originally obtained. We have, for instance,</div>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
2 HAsS<sub>2</sub> ⥂ As<sub>2</sub> S<sub>3</sub> ↓ + H<sub>2</sub>S ↑.
</div></div>

<p>This instability of the sulpho-acids is entirely analogous to the
instability of the metal hydrosulphides (p. <a href="#p203">203</a>) and to the instability
of certain oxygen acids, notably of carbonic acid. Sulpho-carbonic
acid, H<sub>2</sub>CS<sub>3</sub>, is the best-known free acid of this type.
It may be precipitated, undecomposed, as an oil, and its gradual
decomposition into hydrogen sulphide and carbon disulphide may
be observed.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Sulpho-Bases.</h4>—Since one meets, in this group, <em class="italic">sulpho-acids</em>
and <em class="italic">sulpho-salts</em>, corresponding to the oxygen acids and their salts,
one is naturally led to inquire,<a id="FNanchor_495_518" href="#Footnote_495_518" class="fnanchor">495</a> whether the third great class of
oxygen compounds is not found duplicated among sulphur compounds,
whether <em class="italic">sulpho-bases</em>, as well as sulpho-acids and salts, are
known. One would look for such bases, with the most pronounced
basic character, among the compounds obtained by the substitution
of sulphur for oxygen in the strongest oxygen bases. To a
certain extent potassium and sodium hydrosulphides and sulphides
show, in fact, properties, which are akin to those fundamentally
characteristic of ordinary bases. They combine with acid sulphides
to form sulpho-salts, as the oxygen bases combine with acid
oxides. To a very considerable extent they neutralize all but the
very weakest acids; hydrogen sulphide, itself a very weak acid, is
driven out of its salts by all stronger acids, and the latter are
almost completely neutralized. For instance, we have:
<a id="p245" class="xxpn">[p245]</a> KOH + HCl ⥂ KCl + H<sub>2</sub>O, and
KSH + HCl ⥂ KCl + H<sub>2</sub>S and
K<sub>2</sub>S + 2 HCl ⥂ 2 KCl + H<sub>2</sub>S.
The concentration of the hydrogen-ion
is reduced most decidedly in each of these reactions.</div>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p><em class="smcap">Exp.</em>—A solution of potassium hydrosulphide is saturated with hydrogen
sulphide, in order to prevent hydrolysis and the formation of potassium
hydroxide<a id="FNanchor_496_519" href="#Footnote_496_519" class="fnanchor">496</a> (p. <a href="#p180">180</a>), as far as possible, and the solution is added to an acid
(hydrochloric) solution of methyl orange;<a id="FNanchor_497_520" href="#Footnote_497_520" class="fnanchor">497</a> the acid color is changed to orange,
as a result of the almost complete neutralization of the acid. The potassium
hydrosulphide (the hydrosulphide-ion HS<sup>−</sup>) neutralizes the hydrogen-ion
(of hydrochloric acid), that converts methyl orange into its pink salt, and
hydrogen sulphide is formed, which is too weak an acid to affect the color of
the indicator (p. <a href="#p079">79</a>).</p></div>

<p>The objection that potassium sulphide and hydrosulphide are
salts, the salts of hydrogen sulphide, might be raised against the
conception of their possessing a certain measure of basic functions;
but the common oxygen base, potassium hydroxide, is also a salt,
the salt of a still weaker acid, water. Indeed, the characteristic
properties of ordinary bases are due essentially to the fact, that
they are the more or less readily ionizable salts of an extremely
weak acid, water, and these properties may well be duplicated by
salts of other <em class="italic">weak</em> acids, duplicated in a <em class="italic">very much weaker</em> way,
in proportion as the acids are stronger than water. The difference
is, then, really one of <em class="italic">degree</em> and not of kind.<a id="FNanchor_498_521" href="#Footnote_498_521" class="fnanchor">498</a></p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p>Owing to the fact that hydrogen sulphide is a much stronger
acid than water, the action of potassium hydrosulphide on
an acid sulphide, like carbon disulphide (equation (2), p.
<a href="#p243">243</a>), is reversed to a correspondingly
greater degree than the action of potassium hydroxide on carbon
dioxide<a id="FNanchor_499_522" href="#Footnote_499_522"
class="fnanchor">499</a> (equation (1), p. <a href="#p243">243</a>).
The dissociation constant for the secondary ionization of hydrogen
sulphide (HS<sup>−</sup> ⇄ H<sup>+</sup> + S<sup>2−</sup>) is
very much smaller than the constant for the primary ionization
(HS<sup>−</sup> is a much weaker acid than HSH), and so we find
that a sulphide like K<sub>2</sub>S exhibits very much stronger
basic functions than do the hydrosulphides, as, for instance,
in forming salts with acid-forming sulphides <a id="p246"
class="xxpn">[p246]</a> (equation (3), p. <a href="#p243">243</a>)
and in neutralizing acids. There can be no question that, if we
could have an aqueous solution of potassium oxide, K<sub>2</sub>O,
it would show, similarly, the characteristic actions of strong bases
<em class="italic">even more powerfully</em> than the hydroxide,
KOH; for instance, in acting on acid-forming oxides (equation (1),
p. <a href="#p243">243</a>), in neutralizing acids, in saponifying
esters (p. <a href="#p081">81</a>), and so forth. It is, in fact, on account of this
property, that potassium oxide is decomposed by water. It is a salt
involving the <em class="italic">secondary ionization</em> of water,
(HO<sup>−</sup> ⇄ H<sup>+</sup> + O<sup>2−</sup>), which has a much
smaller dissociation constant even than the primary ionization
(H<sub>2</sub>O ⇄ H<sup>+</sup> + HO<sup>−</sup>). The oxide,
K<sub>2</sub>O, is decomposed by <em class="italic">neutralizing
hydrogen ions formed by the primary ionization of water</em>. We have
2 K<sup>+</sup> + O<sup>2−</sup> + H<sup>+</sup> + HO<sup>−</sup> ⥂ 2 K<sup>+</sup> + 2 HO<sup>−</sup>,
which is entirely analogous, in principle, to
K<sup>+</sup> + HO<sup>−</sup> + H<sup>+</sup> + Cl<sup>−</sup> ⥂ K<sup>+</sup> + Cl<sup>−</sup> + HOH.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Sulphoxy-Salts.</h4>—The close relations between the oxygen and the sulphur
series are seen also in the fact that an oxygen base may be combined
with an acid sulphide, and <em class="italic">vice versa</em>; arsenious sulphide, for instance, dissolves
even in the solution of so weak a base as ammonium hydroxide (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). The
salts produced by this "crossing" are usually "hybrid" salts, partly sulpho-,
partly oxygen-salts. There is, for instance, a series of <em class="italic">arseniates</em>,<a id="FNanchor_500_523" href="#Footnote_500_523" class="fnanchor">500</a> Me<sub>3</sub>AsO<sub>4</sub>,
Me<sub>3</sub>AsSO<sub>3</sub>, Me<sub>3</sub>AsS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, Me<sub>3</sub>AsS<sub>3</sub>O and Me<sub>3</sub>AsS<sub>4</sub>. In analytical work the pure
types are ordinarily utilized, rather than the mixed types.</div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Complex Sulphide Ions.</h4>—The ions of the
sulpho-acids, like the ions of oxygen-acids (p. <a href="#p238">238</a>), may also be
treated as <em class="italic">complex ions</em>—of the positive
metal ions and the sulphide-ion, S<sup>2−</sup>. Ammonium sulphide
combines with stannic sulphide, forming ammonium sulphostannate:
SnS<sub>2</sub> + (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S ⇄ (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SnS<sub>3</sub>.
If the action is considered to be the result of
interactions of the ions of stannic and ammonium sulphides,
we can resolve the equation into the following one:
Sn<sup>4+</sup> + 2 S<sup>2−</sup> + 2 NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> + S<sup>2−</sup> ⇄ 2 NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> + SnS<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup>.</div>

<p>The ammonium-ion, appearing with the same coefficient
on both sides of the last equation, evidently takes
no direct part in the action and we have more simply:
Sn<sup>4+</sup> + 3 S<sup>2−</sup> ⇄ SnS<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup>.</p>

<p>For the condition of equilibrium between the complex and its
components we have:<a id="FNanchor_501_524" href="#Footnote_501_524"

<div class="xxpn"><a id="p247" class="xxpn">[p247]</a></div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Sulphurization of Sulphides.</h4>—Since the solubility of the
arsenic group of sulphides in ammonium sulphide solution—the
reagent commonly used in analysis—depends on the formation
of soluble sulpho-salts, due consideration must be taken of
the fact that some of the <em class="italic">lower</em> sulphides—notably stannous,
aurous and platinous sulphides—do not possess acid-forming
properties in any marked degree; even antimonous sulphide is
soluble only in a considerable excess of ammonium sulphide.
In order, then, to insure a more complete separation of the arsenic
from the copper group, precautions are taken to sulphurize the
lower sulphides to higher, stronger acid-forming, sulphides, in the
course of the separation. For this purpose so-called "yellow"
ammonium sulphide, containing persulphides of ammonium,
(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>, etc., is used in place of a solution of ammonium sulphide
and ammonium hydrosulphide. Stannous sulphide, for instance,
is dissolved by the reagent as ammonium sulphostannate:
SnS + (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub> ⇄ (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SnS<sub>3</sub>.</div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Behavior of Arsenic Acid toward Hydrogen Sulphide.</h4>—In
conclusion, special consideration must still be given to the behavior
of arsenic acid, H<sub>3</sub>AsO<sub>4</sub>. As its name indicates, it is an
acid, and, in fact, a rather strong acid, of the order of strength<a id="FNanchor_503_526" href="#Footnote_503_526" class="fnanchor">503</a>
of phosphoric acid, H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, which it resembles in composition and
in many of its properties. As a strong acid, arsenic acid, when it
is ionized, yields chiefly negative arseniate ions,
H<sub>2</sub>AsO<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup>,
HAsO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>
and AsO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup>. Any basic properties, which it may and, most likely,
does possess, must be extremely weak. It is, therefore, not surprising
to find that unusual difficulties are experienced in precipitating
arsenic sulphide, by hydrogen sulphide, from arseniate
<a id="p248" class="xxpn">[p248]</a> solutions, in as much as hydrogen sulphide is an agent for the
precipitation of the sulphides of <em class="italic">cations</em>. Arsenious acid, the
hydroxide of the lower oxide, on the other hand, is a much weaker
acid and shows more pronounced basic (amphoteric) properties,
and arsenic trisulphide is precipitated, without difficulty, from
solutions of arsenious acid in hydrochloric acid. We have:
2 As<sup>3+</sup> + 3 S<sup>2−</sup> ⥂ As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> ↓. When arsenic acid is reduced to arsenious
acid by sulphurous acid, by iodides (see Chap. XVI) or by
hydrogen sulphide (see below), no further difficulty in precipitating
a sulphide (As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>) is experienced.</div>

<p>When a solution of arsenic acid, containing the usual small
amount of hydrochloric acid (0.3 molar), is treated with hydrogen

href="#Footnote_510_533" class="fnanchor">510</a> from the action of
the sulphide-ion S<sup>2−</sup> on the positive ion As<sup>5+</sup>
<span class="ibnowrap">(2 As<sup>5+</sup> + 5 S<sup>2−</sup> ⇄</span> <span class="ibnowrap">As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub> ↓).</span>
The favorable action of the hydrochloric acid might,
consequently, be thought to result from the fact, that it <em
class="italic">facilitates</em> the <em class="italic">ionization
of arsenic acid</em> as a base and the formation of a
salt<a id="FNanchor_511_534" href="#Footnote_511_534"
class="fnanchor">511</a> AsCl<sub>5</sub>. It could thus greatly
increase the concentration of the ion As<sup>5+</sup> and facilitate
its combination with the sulphide-ion.</p>

<p>Treatment of a solution of arsenic acid with a concentrated
acid, yielding a large concentration of hydrogen-ion, would
carry the series of actions, represented in the above ionization
equation for arsenic acid, decidedly toward the right—suppressing
the arseniate-ion AsO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup> and increasing
the concentration of the arsenic-ion As<sup>5+</sup>. Since
we cannot apply the equilibrium laws (or the principle of the
solubility-product) to solutions as concentrated as the one
under discussion, a quantitative theoretical treatment of the
subject cannot be given. The following may be suggested: The
action of the acid would be favorable to the precipitation of
As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub> by suppressing the arseniate-ion
AsO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup> and thus increasing the concentration
of the hydroxide As(OH)<sub>5</sub>, available for ionization
as a base and for the production of the ion As<sup>5+</sup>.
But the further favorable effect of the hydrochloric acid,
in converting the hydroxide into a salt AsCl<sub>5</sub> and
increasing thereby the concentration of As<sup>5+</sup>,
would be <em class="italic">very largely offset</em> by
the action of the acid in suppressing the <a id="p250"
class="xxpn">[p250]</a> sulphide-ion ([S<sup>2−</sup>] = <em
class="italic">k</em> / [H<sup>+</sup>]<sup>2</sup>; see p.
<a href="#p201">201</a>). For systems to which the equilibrium laws could be
applied, the concentration of As<sup>5+</sup> (except for the
suppression of the ion AsO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup>) would grow,
approximately, with the fifth power<a id="FNanchor_512_535"
href="#Footnote_512_535" class="fnanchor">512</a> of the
concentration of the hydrogen-ion, and the concentration of
the sulphide-ion would decrease, approximately, proportionally
to the square of the concentration of the hydrogen-ion.
Further, the precipitation of As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub>,
in a system to which the principle of the solubility-product
were applicable, would depend on the relation of the product
[As<sup>5+</sup>]<sup>2</sup> × [S<sup>2−</sup>]<sup>5</sup> to
the solubility-product constant; it is evident that the value for
[As<sup>5+</sup>]<sup>2</sup> would <em class="italic">increase</em>
proportionally to the tenth power of [H<sup>+</sup>] and the value
of [S<sup>2−</sup>] <em class="italic">decrease</em> proportionally
to the tenth power of the same factor [H<sup>+</sup>]. The two
effects would consequently offset each other under such conditions.
However, the equilibrium laws cannot legitimately be applied to
such concentrated solutions and the relation has been developed
only to indicate opposing factors, which must be taken into
account. An experimental study of the problem would be extremely
interesting.<a id="FNanchor_513_536" href="#Footnote_513_536"
class="fnanchor">513</a> Since it involves the question of the
<em class="italic">minute basic ionization of a moderately strong
acid</em> (H<sub>3</sub>AsO<sub>4</sub>), which may be open to <em
class="italic">measurement</em> (see Chap. XVI), the problem is one
of particular interest and importance.</p></div>

<p>The analytical precautions, taken to insure the precipitation, by
hydrogen sulphide, of arsenic sulphide, when arsenic is present in
quinquivalent form, are based on the observations described; in
quantitative analysis, for the sake of securing a precipitate of
<em class="italic">uniform composition</em>, the aim is to precipitate the pure <em class="italic">pentasulphide</em>
and a considerable excess of hydrochloric acid is used. In
qualitative analysis, where the composition of the precipitate is
a matter of indifference and a large excess of acid would seriously
interfere with the precipitation of certain sulphides (<em class="italic">e.g.</em> CdS, see
p. <a href="#p211">211</a>), a smaller excess of acid is used and the precipitation of
arsenic sulphide is insured by prolonged treatment of a solution
with hydrogen sulphide <em class="italic">at a high temperature</em>.</p>

To a certain extent, the effect of the acid may be

also, the concentrated acid renders inactive a considerable portion

OXIDATION AND REDUCTION REACTIONS. I</h3>

<div class="xxpn"><a id="p251" class="xxpn">[p251]</a>
<a href="#Contents">TOC</a></div>

<p>Oxidation and reduction reactions are frequently met with
in analysis, and we shall turn now to the consideration of such
reactions, from the point of view of the modern theory of solution
and the laws of equilibrium.</p>

<p>Leaving until later the discussion of the most important and
most common oxidizing agents, such as oxygen, nitric acid, permanganate,
etc., we shall, in order to develop the subject most
simply, confine ourselves, for the moment, to the <em class="italic">qualitative</em> study
of some oxidations and reductions met with early in the study of
analytical reactions. One such reaction is the reduction of ferric
salts by hydrogen sulphide, and the simultaneous oxidation of the
latter to sulphur (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). The reaction may be expressed by the
equation</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
2 FeCl<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>S → 2 FeCl<sub>2</sub> + 2 HCl + S ↓.
</div></div>

<p>If the action is considered to be the result of the interaction
of the ionized ferric chloride and hydrogen sulphide, it would be
represented by the equation</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
2 Fe<sup>3+</sup> + 6 Cl<sup>−</sup> + 2 H<sup>+</sup> + S<sup>2−</sup> → 2 Fe<sup>2+</sup> + 6 Cl<sup>−</sup> + 2 H<sup>+</sup> + S ↓.
</div></div>

<p class="continue">It is then clear that the reacting components, according to such
a conception, are the ferric and the sulphide ions, whose electrical
charges mutually discharge each other. Considering only those
components whose charges are changed, we have</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
2 Fe<sup>3+</sup> + S<sup>2−</sup> → 2 Fe<sup>2+</sup> + S ↓.
</div></div>

<p class="continue">The reduction of a ferric to a ferrous salt would then be accomplished
by the discharge of one of the three positive charges on the
ferric ions; the oxidation of hydrogen sulphide to sulphur would be
accomplished by the complete discharge of the sulphide ions.</p>

<p>Ferric salts are reduced, much in the same way, by iodides (<em class="italic">exp.</em>),
iodine being liberated: 2 Fe<sup>3+</sup> + 2 I<sup>−</sup> → 2 Fe<sup>2+</sup> + I<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>Reduction then appears to involve a loss of positive charges by
ions, oxidation a loss of negative charges. <a id="p252" class="xxpn">[p252]</a></p>

<p>Conversely, we frequently have occasion to oxidize
ferrous salts to the ferric condition, and among the most
convenient reagents for the purpose are chlorine and bromine
water (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). For instance, we have
2 FeCl<sub>2</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub> → 2 FeCl<sub>3</sub>, or,
considering the action from the point of view of the theory of
ionization,<a id="FNanchor_514_537" href="#Footnote_514_537"
class="fnanchor">514</a> 2 Fe<sup>2+</sup> + Cl<sub>2</sub> → 2 Fe<sup>3+</sup> + 2 Cl<sup>−</sup>.
In this case
the oxidation of the ferrous to the ferric ion consists in the
assumption of an additional positive charge; reduction of chlorine to
the chloride-ion consists in the assumption of negative charges by
the chlorine atoms.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Definitions of Oxidation and Reduction in
Electric Terms.</h4>—The definitions must then be amplified and
<em class="italic">oxidation be considered to involve ultimately
the assumption of positive, or the loss of negative, electrical
charges by ions or atoms, reduction to involve ultimately the
assumption of negative, or the loss of positive, charges</em>.
According to the electron theory of electricity a unit negative
charge is an electron, the unit positive charge, probably, the
charge left on an atom when it has lost an electron; and, thus,
oxidation may simply be defined, according to the electric theory of
oxidation and reduction, as consisting, fundamentally, in the <em
class="italic">loss of electrons by atoms or ions</em>, reduction
as consisting in a <em class="italic">gain of electrons</em>.
For instance, when hydrogen sulphide reduces a ferric salt,
2 Fe<sup>3+</sup> + S<sup>2−</sup> → 2 Fe<sup>2+</sup> + S, <em
class="italic">the sulphide ions transfer their electrons to the
ferric ions</em>.</div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Oxidations and Reductions by Electric
Currents.</h4>—All of the oxidation and reduction reactions
which have been discussed may, in fact, be effected by the
use of an <em class="italic">electric current</em> in the
place of chemical agents. Ferrous salts, for instance, are <em
class="italic">oxidized</em>, at the positive pole, by the current
to ferric salts:<a id="FNanchor_515_538" href="#Footnote_515_538"
class="fnanchor">515</a></div>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">

</div></div>

<p class="continue">Ferric salts are <em class="italic">reduced</em>, at the negative pole, to ferrous salts:</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
Fe<sup>3+</sup> + ⊖ → Fe<sup>2+</sup>, or Fe<sup>3+</sup> + ε<sup>−</sup> → Fe<sup>2+</sup>.
</div></div>

<div class="xxpn"><a id="p253" class="xxpn">[p253]</a></div>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p><em class="smcap">Exp.</em>—A solution of ferrous chloride, freshly prepared from iron wire, or
a freshly prepared solution of ferrous-ammonium sulphate, is placed in a very
small beaker; a solution of ferric chloride, acidulated with hydrochloric acid
to prevent subsequent complete reduction of the ferric-ion to iron, is brought
into a similar beaker. A small amount (5 c.c.) of each solution is tested,
the former with potassium thiocyanate and the latter with ferricyanide
solution, to show the absence of perceptible quantities of ferric and ferrous
ions in them, respectively. Platinum electrodes, consisting best of cylinders
of platinum gauze, are introduced into the solutions, the solutions are
connected by means of a "salt bridge" (a U-tube filled with a solution of
sodium chloride and closed at both ends by plugs of filter paper), and a current
of 0.2 ampere is passed through the system, the positive current entering
the solution containing the ferrous salt. After the current has been allowed to
pass for a minute or two, 5 c.c. is withdrawn, by a pipette, from the meshes of
the positive electrode and tested with thiocyanate, and 5 c.c., withdrawn in the
same way from the negative electrode, is tested with potassium ferricyanide.</p></div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Production of Electric Currents by Means of Oxidation and
Reduction Reactions.</h4>—Not only may all the oxidations and
reductions which we have discussed be accomplished with the aid
of the electric current, but <em class="italic">vice versa</em>, an electric current may
readily be produced by a proper arrangement of the components
of any one of these reactions. Care need only be taken to have
the simultaneous loss and gain of electrons, characteristic of all
oxidation and reduction reactions, occur in separate localities,
which must be connected, however, in such a way as to make the
transfer of electrons, a flow of electricity, possible.</div>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p><em class="smcap">Exp.</em> For instance, some ferric chloride and sodium chloride solution may
be put into a small beaker, some sodium chloride solution into a second
beaker of the same size, and the two solutions connected, first by means of a
"salt-bridge," and then by means of two platinum electrodes dipping into
the solutions and connected with the terminals of a sensitive voltmeter.<a id="FNanchor_516_539" href="#Footnote_516_539" class="fnanchor">516</a> If
<a id="p254" class="xxpn">[p254]</a> all of the connections are made, the introduction of the "salt-bridge" being
left to the last, a momentary slight motion of the needle is observed, when
the bridge is introduced. The needle then falls back to the zero point (see
p. <a href="#p276">276</a>). If now some hydrogen sulphide water is poured into the beaker
containing sodium chloride, a decided, and continuing, deflection of the
needle of the voltmeter is immediately observed, showing the passage of an
electric current, and it is in the direction anticipated by the consideration of
the reaction equation: 2 Fe<sup>3+</sup> + S<sup>2−</sup> → 2 Fe<sup>2+</sup> + S ↓. The positive current
passes into the voltmeter from the ferric chloride solution, where ferric ions
are giving up their charges; the negative current enters the voltmeter from
the solution containing the hydrogen sulphide, where sulphide ions are being
discharged. The "salt-bridge" is necessary to complete the electrical circuit
and prevent any local accumulation of positive or negative electricity
(polarization). For instance, as the ferric ions are discharged, an excess of
chloride ions would remain in the beaker, rendering the solution negative
and preventing the flow of electricity from the electrode, if negative ions
did not move off, through the "salt-bridge," into the beaker containing hydrogen
sulphide and, simultaneously, positive ions migrate into the beaker containing
the ferric salt. Similarly, the accumulation of positive electricity
in the hydrogen sulphide solution, on account of the hydrogen ions left free
by the discharge of sulphide ions, is prevented by the flow of positive ions
(sodium and hydrogen) through the U-tube into the beaker containing the ferric
chloride and the flow of negative (chloride) ions into the hydrogen sulphide
solution. Thus a current of electricity passes through the whole circuit.</p></div>

<p>It is thus possible to reduce ferric chloride in one vessel by
hydrogen sulphide poured into another vessel,<a id="FNanchor_517_540" href="#Footnote_517_540" class="fnanchor">517</a> and an electric
current may be obtained from the simultaneous discharge of the
sulphide and ferric ions in the action.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Effects of Ion Concentrations on the Current.</h4>—Hydrogen sulphide,
it will be recalled, is an extremely weak acid (p. <a href="#p199">199</a>), only
a very small proportion is ionized and, consequently, the concentration
of the discharging (reducing) sulphide-ion must be minute
in this solution. Its salts, however, are highly ionized, and by
the addition of an alkali to the solution containing the hydrogen
sulphide, the concentration of the discharging ion would be very
greatly increased and the current should therefore be intensified
most decidedly—provided the hydrogen sulphide really reduces
<em class="italic">by means of its negative ion and not by the action of the nonionized
acid</em>. As a matter of fact, the anticipated decided increase in
the intensity of the current is observed, when alkali is added to
the mixture containing the hydrogen sulphide (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). Similarly,
<a id="p255" class="xxpn">[p255]</a> we have assumed that the oxidizing agent is the highly charged
ferric-ion, not the nonionized ferric salt. Now iron forms rather
<em class="italic">stable complex ions</em><a id="FNanchor_518_541" href="#Footnote_518_541" class="fnanchor">518</a> with the fluoride-ion, for instance, FeF<sub>6</sub><sup>3−</sup>,
which yield ferric ions very much less readily than do ferric salts.
Hence the addition of a fluoride—potassium or ammonium fluoride—should,
according to this view, reduce the oxidizing power of
the iron solution by suppressing the ferric-ion and converting it
into the complex FeF<sub>6</sub><sup>3−</sup>. In fact, the addition of potassium fluoride
immediately reduces the intensity of the current (<em class="italic">exp.</em>), and,
simultaneously, the deep yellow-brown color of the ferric salt solution
gives way to the very pale yellow tint of the complex ion and
its salt.<a id="FNanchor_519_542" href="#Footnote_519_542" class="fnanchor">519</a></div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Further Illustrations.</h4>—If ferrous sulphate solution is put
into one beaker and sodium chloride solution into another, connections
being made similar to those used in the previous experiment,
then a vigorous current is instantly produced (<em class="italic">exp.</em>), when
some bromine or chlorine water is added to the sodium chloride
solution, the positive current flowing into the voltmeter from the
beaker containing the bromine (chlorine); the bromine atoms
(chlorine atoms) combine with electrons lost by the ferrous ions
and are reduced to bromide ions (chloride ions) (see p. <a href="#p252">252</a>).</div>

<p>It would appear possible, in fact, to obtain an electrical current
from any oxidation-reduction reaction, if the oxidizing and reducing
agents can be, experimentally, properly arranged for this
purpose.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Summary.</h4>—We find thus that there is a most intimate
connection between oxidation and reduction phenomena and electrical
charges on atoms or ions. In the first place, an electrical
current may be used as an oxidizing and reducing agent; indeed,
a current cannot be passed through any solution without simultaneous
oxidation and reduction at the positive and negative
poles, respectively. And, conversely, an electric current may, in
turn, be produced by a proper combination of the reagents in
oxidation and reduction reactions.</div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Need of the Study of the Quantitative Relations.</h4>—The
interpretation of such actions from the point of view of the theory
<a id="p256" class="xxpn">[p256]</a> of ionization offers, then, no particular difficulties. But, as far as
we have developed the theory, that is, essentially from its qualitative
side, difficulty would be encountered in understanding why
certain other reactions, involving a similar simultaneous discharge
of positive and negative electricity by ions, which might be expected
to take place, do not seem to take place. Thus, solutions
of ferric sulphate do not appear to be reduced appreciably by
the hydroxide and oxide ions of the water present. Although the
possibility of such a reduction exists through the simultaneous
discharge of the positive electricity of the ferric ions and the
negative charge on the oxide ions (or hydroxide ions) of water
(4 Fe<sup>3+</sup> + O<sup>2−</sup> → 4 Fe<sup>2+</sup> + O<sub>2</sub> or 4 Fe<sup>3+</sup> + 4 HO<sup>−</sup> → 4 Fe<sup>2+</sup> + O<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O),
comparable with the reduction of ferric ions by
sulphide ions, such a reduction does not take place appreciably.<a id="FNanchor_520_543" href="#Footnote_520_543" class="fnanchor">520</a>
And, similarly, whereas the iodide-ion, as we have seen, reduces
the ferric-ion very readily, the analogous chloride-ion does not
appear to do so. Sodium chloride may be added to ferric sulphate
solution and potassium ferricyanide fails to show that any
ferrous salt is produced (<em class="italic">exp.</em>).</div>

<p>The mere possibility of a transfer of charges, or electrons, is
therefore apparently<a id="FNanchor_521_544" href="#Footnote_521_544" class="fnanchor">521</a> not sufficient to induce an oxidation and
reduction reaction—much in the same way as, for instance, the
mere presence, simultaneously, of the barium-ion and the carbonate-ion,
in itself, does not necessarily lead to the precipitation of
barium carbonate (p. <a href="#p090">90</a>), although the latter is difficultly soluble.
In order to understand the problem of precipitation or nonprecipitation
of salts, it was found necessary to examine the question
from its <em class="italic">quantitative</em> side (p. <a href="#p091">91</a>), and, similarly, the solution of
the difficulty concerning the occurrence or nonoccurrence of oxidation
and reduction reactions, where the possibility of a transfer
of electrons is given, will be found in a study of the problem from
its quantitative side.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Oxidation and Reduction Reactions as Reversible Reactions.</h4>—In
order to reduce the development of the quantitative
<a id="p257" class="xxpn">[p257]</a> relations to the simplest possible terms, we may turn to still
simpler oxidation and reduction reactions than those studied thus
far. If a rod of zinc is placed in a solution of copper sulphate,
copper is deposited and zinc sulphate is formed. If we consider
the action to be an ionic one, we have:</div>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
Cu<sup>2+</sup> + SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> + Zn ↓ → Zn<sup>2+</sup> + SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> + Cu ↓,
</div></div>

<p class="continue">or, since the sulphate-ion is not directly concerned in the action,
we have more simply:</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
Cu<sup>2+</sup> + Zn ↓ → Cu ↓ + Zn<sup>2+</sup>.
</div></div>

<p class="continue">Cupric-ion has been reduced, therefore, to metallic copper, the
metallic zinc oxidized to zinc-ion, each zinc atom transferring two
electrons to a cupric ion.</p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<div class="tabdiv">Closer analysis of the action shows that this interpretation of the action,
from the electrical point of view, is not at all in conflict with the older definitions
and conceptions of oxidation and reduction: copper is deprived
of the oxygen with which it is combined in nonionized copper sulphate,

find, however, that it is just in the quantitative formulation of the relations,
that the interpretation of the action from the point of view of the theory of
ionization has proved its superiority over the older view.</div></div>

<p>If a strip of copper is placed in a solution of mercuric nitrate,
copper, in turn, is dissolved, being oxidized to the form of cupric-ion,
and mercury is deposited:</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
Cu ↓ + Hg<sup>2+</sup> → Cu<sup>2+</sup> + Hg ↓.
</div></div>

<p class="continue">We find, then, that cupric-ion has a tendency to give up its charges,
to be reduced to the metallic condition; metallic copper, in turn,
has a tendency to revert to the ionic condition, to be oxidized
and to form cupric-ion. We may consider the two opposed
tendencies, shown in these relations, as representing a <em class="italic">reversible</em>
reaction:</p>

pole. <a id="p258" class="xxpn">[p258]</a></p></div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Condition of Equilibrium.</h4>—For such a reversible reaction
we might expect, if we may apply the law of equilibrium to it,
that the ratio of the concentrations of copper and of the cupric-ion
would be a constant for the <em class="italic">condition of equilibrium</em> at a given
temperature.<a id="FNanchor_522_545" href="#Footnote_522_545" class="fnanchor">522</a> We would then have:</div>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
[Cu<sup>2+</sup>] / [Cu ↓] = <em class="italic">k</em>.

<p class="continue">Since the concentration [Cu ↓] of a pure, dense<a id="FNanchor_523_546" href="#Footnote_523_546" class="fnanchor">523</a> piece of copper
may be considered a constant at a given temperature, it would
follow, that the first term in our relation would also have a constant
definite value for the condition of equilibrium between the
metal and its ion. Consequently, <em class="italic">for the condition of equilibrium</em>
we would have:</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
[Cu<sup>2+</sup>] = K<sub>Cu<sup>2+</sup></sub>.
</div></div>

<p class="continue">Metallic copper would then be in equilibrium, at a given temperature,
with solutions containing cupric-ion only if the latter
has a perfectly definite, constant concentration. Nernst<a id="FNanchor_524_547" href="#Footnote_524_547" class="fnanchor">524</a> discovered
this and similar relations, as a result of a more rigorous
analysis of the energy changes involved in the ionization and
precipitation of metals, and proved the validity of the relations.
The value of the constant,<a id="FNanchor_525_548" href="#Footnote_525_548" class="fnanchor">525</a> which, according to Nernst's
<a id="p259" class="xxpn">[p259]</a> suggestion is called the <em class="bold">electrolytic solution-tension constant</em>, is
8E−22 for copper<a id="FNanchor_526_549" href="#Footnote_526_549" class="fnanchor">526</a>; that is, copper is directly in equilibrium
with a solution containing cupric-ion only if the concentration of
the latter is 8E−22 gram-ion per liter.</p>

<p>We see, then, that copper would be directly in equilibrium
with solutions of cupric salts only if they contain this exceedingly
minute concentration of cupric ions. When such is the case, the
ionization of the metal and the formation of the metal, by the
deposit of discharging ions, may be considered to proceed <em class="italic">with
the same velocity</em> (p. <a href="#p094">94</a>).</p>

<p>But, if the metal is dipped into a solution of greater concentration
of cupric ions than that represented by the constant, say
into a solution of 0.1 molar copper sulphate, the velocity of deposition
of the metal would be proportionally increased (p. <a href="#p092">92</a>),
while the velocity of ionization and solution of the metal would
remain unchanged. We would consequently have the ions discharging
and forming metal more rapidly than they are formed.
A condition of change, not of equilibrium, exists. If we <a id="p260" class="xxpn">[p260]</a>
consider the changes that must occur, we see that the ions, discharging
on the metal, would <em class="italic">charge</em> it with <em class="italic">positive electricity</em>, and
the positive charge would, in turn, repel from the metal the
positive cupric ions remaining in the solution. Equilibrium
would be expected to result when the charge on the plate becomes
heavy enough to repel from the film, immediately surrounding
it, all the cupric ions excepting those representing a
concentration of 8E−22, as required by the value of the equilibrium
constant. The positive charge on the plate would attract
and hold negative sulphate ions, freed by the discharge of
cupric ions, in a kind of "double layer," the surface of the metal
holding positive charges and the film of liquid in contact with it
holding an excess of negative ions. An <em class="italic">electric potential</em> would thus
be established between the positive metal and the negative solution,
bathing it.<a id="FNanchor_527_550" href="#Footnote_527_550" class="fnanchor">527</a> It is evident that the more concentrated the solution
of cupric ions, the heavier the charge must be that will be required
to repel the cupric ions sufficiently to establish equilibrium.<a id="FNanchor_528_551" href="#Footnote_528_551" class="fnanchor">528</a></p>

<p>If copper is placed in a solution in which the concentration of
the cupric ions is smaller than the constant 8E−22, the velocity
of ionization will be greater than the velocity of the deposition of
the metal. The ions formed, having assumed positive charges,
will leave a negative charge on the metal, and, as a result of
the electrical attraction, a "double layer," surrounding the metal,
will again be formed, the positive ions clinging to the negative
metal. Equilibrium will be reached when the concentration of the
cupric ions originally present, increased by the new ions formed
in this "double layer," will have reached, in the film bathing the
plate, the concentration demanded by the equilibrium constant.
An electrical potential will be established as before, the metal
being negative, the solution, in this case, positive.</p>

<p>By developing the quantitative relations between osmotic
forces and the electrical potential, Nernst[3] was able
to show that, at room temperature<a id="FNanchor_529_552"
href="#Footnote_529_552" class="fnanchor">529</a> (17°–18°), the
following logarithmic relation <a id="p261" class="xxpn">[p261]</a>

between a <em class="italic">metal</em><a id="FNanchor_530_553"

<p class="continue">In this equation ε<sub>Me, Me-salt</sub> is the electrical potential, in volts,

in the present case, it is identical with the <em class="italic">valence</em> of the metal

K and C, the corresponding <em class="italic">osmotic pressures</em> of the metal ion

</div></div>

<p class="continue">When the concentration of cupric-ion is equal to the constant,

</div></div>

<p class="continue">It is also clear, from this equation, that the greater the difference
in concentration of the cupric-ion in the two solutions, the greater
should be the potential difference produced. The following series
of experiments illustrates these relations and confirms the conclusions
reached. <a id="p264" class="xxpn">[p264]</a></p>

<p>If two electrodes of pure copper are introduced into solutions
of cupric sulphate of equal concentration,<a id="FNanchor_534_557" href="#Footnote_534_557" class="fnanchor">534</a> no current is produced,
when the solutions are connected by a "salt bridge" and the electrodes
with a voltmeter (<em class="italic">exp.</em>; the chemometer described on p. <a href="#p253">253</a>
is used). If one of the beakers is partially emptied, only a few
drops of the solution being left in it, and is then filled with a
solution of sodium sulphate, we notice that the voltmeter immediately
indicates the establishing of a potential difference—a current
is produced. From the experimental arrangement and from the
manner of the deflection of the needle of the chemometer, we note,
too, that the plate dipping into the more concentrated solution of
the cupric-ion is the positive pole, and hence the cupric ions are
discharged on it; this solution is therefore growing less concentrated
in regard to cupric-ion. In the other vessel, copper is dissolving
and the concentration of cupric-ion is increasing. Both
changes tend toward equalizing the concentrations in the two
solutions and thus toward establishing equilibrium.</p>

<p>The <em class="italic">diffusion</em> of ions, from and to the plates, is a very slow
process (p. <a href="#p008">8</a>), and since the potential produced depends on the
momentary concentrations of the liquid films immediately next to
the plates, the potential difference, first observed, is seen to disappear
rapidly. More decided and lasting potential differences are
obtained by introducing reagents, which keep the concentration of
the cupric-ion, automatically, at very low values in the one solution,
and which thus make us less dependent on the slow diffusion
of the ions around the plates. We may add, for instance, sodium
hydroxide to a solution of copper sulphate to precipitate cupric
hydroxide; cupric hydroxide being a difficultly soluble compound,
its saturated solution contains only a very small concentration of
<a id="p265" class="xxpn">[p265]</a> cupric-ion. If we connect, again, copper plates in two equally
concentrated solutions of copper sulphate, and add a little more
than the equivalent amount of sodium hydroxide to the solution
holding the plate connected with the <em class="italic">negative</em> post of the voltmeter,
cupric hydroxide is thereby precipitated, and we note that a decided
difference of potential is established and <em class="italic">maintained</em> (<em class="italic">exp.</em>).
An excess of a concentrated solution of sodium hydroxide should,
according to the principle of the solubility-product, reduce the
concentration of cupric-ion still more, and the potential is, in fact,
thereby increased (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). Cupric sulphide is much less soluble
than cupric hydroxide, and if we add sodium sulphide (a little
more than one equivalent) to the mixture containing the hydroxide,
we find that the hydroxide is converted into the less soluble,
black sulphide, leaving a still smaller concentration of cupric-ion
in this solution, and the potential is again increased (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). We
found that the complex ions of copper with the cyanide-ion are
so extremely stable as to allow of the existence of a concentration
of cupric-ion so minute, that copper sulphide cannot be precipitated
from cyanide solutions (p. <a href="#p228">228</a>). If sufficient potassium
cyanide is added to the mixture containing the suspension of cupric
sulphide, the sulphide dissolves readily,<a id="FNanchor_535_558" href="#Footnote_535_558" class="fnanchor">535</a> and the largest potential
difference, yet noted, is produced.<a id="FNanchor_536_559" href="#Footnote_536_559" class="fnanchor">536</a> We find thus that the behavior
of the metal, in contact with these different solutions, agrees with
the demands of the theory.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Equilibrium Relations between Two Metals and Their
Ions.</h4>—The tendency of a metal to ionize and of its ion to be
reduced has been aptly likened to the tendency of a liquid to
form its vapor and of the vapor to condense to its liquid (the
name solution <em class="italic">tension</em> expresses the analogy to vapor <em class="italic">tension</em>). As
different liquids have vastly different tendencies to vaporize at a
given temperature, so different metals, different elements, have
vastly different tendencies to ionize. We shall consider, briefly,
this tendency also in the case of zinc.</div>

<p>In aqueous solutions, the concentration of zinc-ion with which
the metal would be in equilibrium, as found by calculation from
the potential difference between zinc and zinc sulphate solutions
<a id="p266" class="xxpn">[p266]</a> of realizable concentrations of zinc-ion, is 10<sup>17</sup>, a value<a id="FNanchor_537_560" href="#Footnote_537_560" class="fnanchor">537</a> enormously
larger than 10<sup>−21</sup>, the value of the corresponding constant for
copper. A zinc rod, in contact with a solution of a zinc salt, like
zinc sulphate, will acquire a <em class="italic">negative charge</em>, as the metal must
ionize much more rapidly than the ion will be discharged, since
even a saturated solution would contain only a relatively small
concentration of the ion. Copper, as we have seen, placed in a
copper sulphate solution of moderate concentration, is charged
with <em class="italic">positive</em> electricity, the concentration of cupric-ion being very
much larger than that required for the condition of equilibrium
between the metal and its ion. When zinc, immersed in a zinc
sulphate solution, and copper, immersed in a copper sulphate
solution, are connected through a metal circuit, <em class="italic">e.g.</em> that of a
voltmeter, and the solutions are connected by a "salt-bridge"
(<em class="italic">exp.</em>), a current is established, the positive current flowing
from the copper through the metal circuit to the zinc, metallic
copper being deposited and zinc going into solution. The combination
represents the well-known Daniell cell. We note that in
each solution the change in concentration of the ion is towards
the solution-tension constant, <em class="italic">towards a condition of equilibrium</em>.
We may inquire, a little more closely, what would be the
condition for equilibrium for such a system. If we imagine a
copper plate dipping into a solution containing a concentration
of 10<sup>−21</sup> of cupric-ion (the solution-tension constant), the metal
will be directly in equilibrium with the solution and will not
acquire any electrical charge. If we imagine a zinc rod immersed,
in the same way, in a solution containing a concentration
of zinc-ion of 10<sup>17</sup> (this is not practically feasible), the metal and
its ion would also be in equilibrium with each other and the
metal would not assume any charge. It is evident that, if the
zinc and copper and the solutions of their salts were connected,
no current would be established,
<a id="p267" class="xxpn">[p267]</a> <em class="italic">zinc would not be oxidized to zinc-ion,
and cupric-ion would not be reduced. In this condition of
equilibrium, then, the ratio of the concentrations of the respective ions in
the solutions bathing the metals would be, also, the ratio of the solution-tension
constants.</em> This is a <em class="italic">general relation</em> for these two metals—the
individual concentrations of the ions need not have the
value of the solution-tension constants, but <em class="italic">equilibrium will be
established whenever the ratio of the concentrations of the cupric-ion
and the zinc-ion has the same value as the ratio of the solution-tension
constants</em>.<a id="FNanchor_538_561" href="#Footnote_538_561" class="fnanchor">538</a> The condition for equilibrium, in mathematical
form, is then</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
<span class="ibnowrap">
[Zn<sup>2+</sup>] / [Cu<sup>2+</sup>] = K<sub>Zn</sub> / K<sub>Cu</sub> = K<sub>eq.</sub>; and
<br />
K<sub>Zn</sub> / K<sub>Cu</sub> = 10<sup>17</sup> / 1E−21 = 10<sup>38</sup> = K<sub>eq.</sub>
</span></div></div>

<p class="continue">The nearer the ratio is to the equilibrium constant, the smaller
the potential will be, until, when the constant is reached, it becomes
0. We cannot increase the concentration of zinc-ion indefinitely
in order to reach the condition of equilibrium, but we may reduce
the concentration of cupric-ion practically at will, as we have seen
(p. <a href="#p265">265</a>), and we may thus approach the constant. In fact, if we
add to the copper sulphate solution of the copper-zinc element,
described above, a solution of sodium hydroxide, and thus leave, in
the solution, only the small concentration of cupric-ion belonging to
the difficultly soluble cupric hydroxide, the potential of the copper-zinc
element is decidedly reduced (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). If sodium sulphide is
added to the cupric hydroxide, to convert the hydroxide into
the less soluble sulphide, which yields a smaller concentration of
cupric-ion, the potential is again reduced most decidedly (<em class="italic">exp.</em>).
It has now so small a value that we may readily anticipate that,
if the cupric-ion is suppressed so thoroughly, by the addition of
potassium cyanide, that even the sulphide cannot persist, the
value of the ratio [Zn<sup>2+</sup>] : [Cu<sup>2+</sup>] may grow even larger than the
<a id="p268" class="xxpn">[p268]</a> equilibrium constant 10<sup>38</sup>, and we would have a system in which
chemical change in the <em class="italic">opposite direction must result from the
tendency to establish equilibrium</em>. In fact, if potassium cyanide is
added to the mixture surrounding the copper plate, in sufficient
quantity to dissolve the sulphide, we find that a current is established

to cupric-ion</em> (<em class="italic">exp.</em>).</p>

<p>We may apply the conclusions, reached, to the action of metallic
zinc when it is introduced into the solution of a cupric salt. The
oxidation of zinc to the zinc-ion and the reduction of the cupric-ion
to copper must be <em class="italic">reversible</em> reactions, Zn ↓ + Cu<sup>2+</sup> ⇄ Zn<sup>2+</sup> + Cu ↓,
which will come to a condition of equilibrium, according to the
laws of equilibrium, when [Zn<sup>2+</sup>] : [Cu<sup>2+</sup>] = K = 10<sup>38</sup>. The value
of this ratio shows that the cupric-ion will be <em class="italic">practically</em> completely
reduced, and precipitated as copper, by a sufficient quantity
of zinc, the trace of cupric-ion, required to maintain the
equilibrium ratio, being too minute to be detected. By the study
of this oxidation and reduction reaction with the aid of potential
differences, as just described, the validity of the relation is subject
to demonstration, and the value of the equilibrium constant is
brought into definite relation to the solution-tension constants of
the metals.</p>

<p>Each element has its own characteristic solution-tension constant
(see the table at the end of Chapter XV), and the relation
just established for the reduction of cupric-ion, at the expense of
the oxidation of metallic zinc, may be applied to any pair of metals
and their ions.<a id="FNanchor_540_563" href="#Footnote_540_563" class="fnanchor">540</a></p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>General Principles Concerning Equilibrium in Reversible
Oxidation and Reduction Reactions.</h4>—We may now extend the
conclusions, reached in the study of these particularly simple oxidations
and reductions, to oxidation and reduction reactions in
general. We must expect that, <em class="italic">when such an action is reversible</em>
and subject to the laws of equilibrium, its course will, as in all
<a id="p269" class="xxpn">[p269]</a> previous applications of the equilibrium laws, depend, at a given
temperature, in the first place, <em class="italic">on the values of constants</em>. The
(solution-tension) constants, involved in this class of actions,
measure what we may call the affinity of atoms and ions for electric
charges, or electrons. In the second place, the course of the
action will depend, in each case, on the concentrations of the ions,
concentrations which are, to a considerable extent, <em class="italic">variable</em> at will,
as we go from case to case. In the third place, all such reversible
reactions will come ultimately to a <em class="italic">condition of equilibrium</em>, in
which neither action is absolutely completed, and the course of
the action, in any given system not in equilibrium, will always
<em class="italic">proceed toward</em> this condition of equilibrium.</div>

<p>The oxidation and reduction reactions, such as Zn ↓ + Cu<sup>2+</sup> ⇄ Cu ↓ + Zn<sup>2+</sup>,
to which we have heretofore limited the discussion
of the quantitative relations, are particularly simple actions, involving
only <em class="italic">two</em> variables (in this case [Cu<sup>2+</sup>] and [Zn<sup>2+</sup>]). But
the knowledge of the general principles of the quantitative relations
will now enable us to answer questions, in connection with
more complicated cases, which the qualitative relations alone did
not put us into the position of answering (see p. <a href="#p256">256</a>).</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Applications; Reduction of Ferric Salts and Oxidation of
Ferrous Salts.</h4>—It will not be difficult to arrive now at definite
conceptions as to why certain reactions of oxidation and reduction
do not seem to take place, although they are, qualitatively,
entirely analogous to reactions which take place readily. The
study of one of the questions previously raised (see p. <a href="#p256">256</a>),
namely as to why ferric ions apparently are not reducible by chloride
ions, while they are easily reduced by iodide ions, will be
sufficient to illustrate the application of the principles.</div>

<p>In considering the question of the possible reduction of ferric
to ferrous ions, at the expense of the oxidation of chloride ions
to chlorine, we must bear in mind the fact that the reduction of
the ferric ions is a <em class="italic">reversible process</em>, Fe<sup>3+</sup> ⇄ Fe<sup>2+</sup>, and that the
oxidation of chloride ions to chlorine is also a <em class="italic">reversible process</em>,
2 Cl<sup>−</sup> ⇄ Cl<sub>2</sub>. We will deal first, in some detail, with the action
Fe<sup>3+</sup> ⇄ Fe<sup>2+</sup>. For this reversible action we have an <em class="italic">equilibrium
constant</em><a id="FNanchor_541_564" href="#Footnote_541_564" class="fnanchor">541</a> [Fe<sup>2+</sup>] : [Fe<sup>3+</sup>] = K<sub>Ferro, Ferri</sub> = 10<sup>17</sup>, which must be
<a id="p270" class="xxpn">[p270]</a> taken into account in all oxidation and reduction reactions involving
these ions.<a id="FNanchor_542_565" href="#Footnote_542_565" class="fnanchor">542</a> In a system containing the two ions, the
tendency towards reduction of ferric-ion and the tendency toward
oxidation of ferro-ion <em class="italic">would be directly in equilibrium</em> (<em class="italic">i.e.</em> without
the intervention of other opposed forces, such as an electric potential,
produced by an opposing cell or produced by an opposing
action<a id="FNanchor_543_566" href="#Footnote_543_566" class="fnanchor">543</a> of other components in the solution) <em class="italic">only when the concentration
of ferro-ion is 10<sup>17</sup> times as great as the concentration of
ferric-ion</em>.</p>

<p>If we connect a 0.1-molar solution of ferric chloride with
a 0.1-molar solution of ferrous chloride, by means of a "salt
bridge" and a pair of platinum electrodes dipping into the
solutions and connected with the voltmeter (see p. <a href="#p253">253</a>), a
current is produced, the positive current entering the voltmeter
from the electrode placed in the ferric chloride solution (<em
class="italic">exp.</em>). It is evident that, in the effort to
establish equilibrium, <em class="italic">ferric ions</em> in the
ferric chloride solution <em class="italic">are reduced</em> at the
expense of the <em class="italic">oxidation of ferrous ions</em>
in the ferrous chloride solution. If we consider only the ratio of
the concentration of the ferro-ion to that of the ferric-ion in
each of the salt solutions and leave out of consideration, for the
moment, other, secondary, electrical forces,<a id="FNanchor_544_567"
href="#Footnote_544_567" class="fnanchor">544</a> it is clear
that the ratio <a id="p271"
class="xxpn">[p271]</a>
[Fe<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>1</sub>&#8201;:&#8201;[Fe<sup>3+</sup>]<sub>1</sub> in
the ferrous salt solution, considered by itself, is far
closer to the point of equilibrium<a id="FNanchor_545_568"
href="#Footnote_545_568" class="fnanchor">545</a> than the ratio
[Fe<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>2</sub>&#8201;:&#8201;[Fe<sup>3+</sup>]<sub>2</sub> in the
ferric chloride solution, in which the concentration of ferric-ion is
enormously <em class="italic">greater</em> than that of ferro-ion,
while the equilibrium constant demands that the ferro-ion should
be in great <em class="italic">excess</em>. The strongest tendency
to change must be toward a reduction of the concentration of the
ferric-ion in the solution of ferric chloride, which is in agreement
with the observed direction of the current. Equilibrium, it may be
added, will be reached when the <em class="italic">ratio</em> of
the concentration of ferro-ion to that of ferric-ion is the <em
class="italic">same</em> in both solutions.<a id="FNanchor_546_569"
href="#Footnote_546_569" class="fnanchor">546</a></p>

<p>The addition of potassium fluoride to the ferric chloride solution
converts the ferric-ion into the rather stable complex ferrifluoride-ion
FeF<sub>6</sub><sup>3−</sup>, whose potassium salt K<sub>3</sub>FeF<sub>6</sub> is formed. The
<a id="p272" class="xxpn">[p272]</a> concentration of ferric-ion being <em class="italic">decidedly</em> reduced, the system
must be nearer to the condition of equilibrium, the potential must
fall (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). It is again evident (p. <a href="#p255">255</a>) that the <em class="italic">oxidizing agent</em>
is clearly the <em class="italic">ferric-ion</em>, and not the total quantity of the ferric
salt in the solution.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Intensity of Reactions.</h4>—<em class="italic">Vice versa</em>, any oxidizing agent,
which has the power to oxidize ferro-ion to ferric-ion, <em class="italic">does so the
more readily and vigorously</em>, the more completely any ferric-ion,
present or formed, is suppressed. If ferrous sulphate is added to
a solution of silver nitrate, a <em class="italic">slow</em><a id="FNanchor_547_570" href="#Footnote_547_570" class="fnanchor">547</a> reduction of the silver-ion, and
oxidation of the ferro-ion, takes place according to Fe<sup>2+</sup> + Ag<sup>+</sup> → Fe<sup>3+</sup> + Ag ↓. Now, if a little potassium fluoride is added to the
mixture, so as to suppress the ferric-ion, which is always present,
by contamination, in the original ferrous sulphate solution, and
which is formed in the action by the silver nitrate, the oxidation
of the ferrous salt and the precipitation of metallic silver is very
much <em class="italic">accelerated</em>,<a id="FNanchor_548_571" href="#Footnote_548_571" class="fnanchor">548</a> and a heavy black precipitate of silver is formed
instantly (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). The experiment is an illustration of the rôle of
potential in oxidation-reduction reactions, the potential and the
reducing power of ferro-ion being decidedly diminished by the
presence of its oxidation product, the ferric-ion.<a id="FNanchor_549_572" href="#Footnote_549_572" class="fnanchor">549</a> It is also a
further illustration of the rôle the <em class="italic">ions</em> play in these actions, the
total amount of ferric salts not being changed by the introduction
of the fluoride, which simply suppresses <em class="italic">ferric ions</em>.</div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Reduction of Ferric Salts by Iodides.</h4>—In the study of the
oxidation of the ferro-ion and the reduction of the ferric-ion, we
<a id="p273" class="xxpn">[p273]</a> have thus far considered only the reversible tendencies of the two
ions to change into each other, tendencies which would be <em class="italic">directly</em>
balanced, in a given solution, without the intervention of other
forces, when the ratio of the concentrations of the ions is that of the
equilibrium constant, 10<sup>17</sup>. In reactions involving the oxidation
of a ferrous salt, we have to deal, however, in exactly the same
way, with the <em class="italic">reversible tendency</em> of the <em class="italic">oxidizing substance</em> to act as
oxidizing agent, and, similarly, in every reduction of a ferric salt,
we have to deal also with the <em class="italic">reversible tendency</em> of the <em class="italic">reducing
agent</em> to act as such. In order to reach some definite conceptions
as to the influences of these conflicting tendencies, we shall consider,
next, the reduction of ferric salts by iodides, and then contrast
this reduction with the action of chlorides on ferric salts, and
we shall thus complete the study of this action (see p. <a href="#p269">269</a>).</div>

<p>For the reduction of ferric salts by iodides (p. <a href="#p251">251</a>), we have
to consider the reversible tendency of iodide-ion to form iodine
and to be formed from iodine: 2 I<sup>−</sup> ⇄ I<sub>2</sub>.
The constant<a id="FNanchor_550_573" href="#Footnote_550_573"

<p>The reduction of ferric salts by iodides is
a <em class="italic">reversible</em> reaction:

be <em class="italic">suppressed</em>, with the aid of potassium fluoride (see p. <a href="#p255">255</a>), and

<div class="h4p"><h4>Action of Chlorides on Ferric Salts.</h4>—Now, when a chloride

<p class="continue">It is evident, from the value of the equilibrium constant, that the
action of chloride-ion on ferric-ion must result quantitatively so
differently from the action of the analogous iodide-ion (p. <a href="#p275">275</a>),
that the net qualitative results are entirely dissimilar. Whereas
in the case of the iodide, liberation of iodine and reduction of the
ferric-ion are bound to be the chief and obvious actions, in the case
of the chloride-ion, on the other hand, the equilibrium constant
demands that there should be no <em class="italic">appreciable</em> reduction of the
ferric-ion or liberation of chlorine—which is in accordance with
our experience (<em class="italic">exp.</em>, p. <a href="#p256">256</a>).</p>

<p>It is noteworthy, however, that the equilibrium relations demand
that at least <em class="italic">traces</em> of chlorine be liberated, and <em class="italic">traces</em> of ferrous
salt be formed, since neither [Fe<sup>++</sup>] nor [Cl<sub>2</sub>] may have the value 0.
If we add some sodium chloride to a solution of sodium sulphate,
connected electrically, in the usual way, with a solution of ferric
sulphate, a very slight momentary current is produced (<em class="italic">exp.</em>).
The liberation of the first traces of chlorine and of ferro-ion on the
electrodes is necessary, and also sufficient, to satisfy the conditions
for equilibrium as expressed by the constant, until diffusion from
the electrodes removes these traces.</p>

the means of interpreting <em class="italic">the differences in results</em> in (qualitatively)

reaction, and which, in certain cases, do produce

The values of this and similar equilibrium constants
are derived by means of Nernst's formula (see below) for the
potential difference between an element and solutions of its
ions. The derivation involves the assumption that this formula
expresses correctly the relation between the potential change and
the concentration change at all concentrations. This assumption
appears to be justified by all experimental indications thus far
observed. The constants are of importance, primarily, for the
calculations which can be made with their aid (see below), and may,
conservatively, be considered to be essentially "calculation factors"
("Rechengrössen," according to Haber. See pp. <a href="#p232">232</a>–<a href="#p237">7</a>, Chapter XII).
The constants may be expressed, as in the text, in terms of (molar)
<em class="italic">concentrations</em> of the ions, or in terms of the <em class="italic">osmotic pressures</em>
of the ions, a molar solution at 0° producing an osmotic pressure of
22.4 atmospheres. Where osmotic pressure and concentration are not
strictly proportional
(<em class="italic">e.g.</em> for concentrated solutions), the osmotic pressure, rather than the
concentration, is the determining factor and, when known, is used in exact calculations.
The plan, pursued in the text, is adopted in order to express these
constants in the terms used for all the other equilibrium constants. It should
be recalled (<em class="italic">e.g.</em> p. <a href="#p030">30</a>) that in calculations, in general, where pressure and
concentration are not strictly proportional, the pressure is the determining
factor. A third method of expressing the solution-tension relations consists
in giving the <em class="italic">potential differences</em>, which exist <em class="italic">between elements</em> and solutions of
their <em class="italic">ions, in which the ions have unit (molar) concentration</em>. These potential
differences are <em class="italic">functions</em> of the solution-tension constants, as will be discussed
below, and the constants, in terms of concentrations or osmotic pressures,
may be easily calculated, from the potential differences, with the aid of this
function (see below, and see the table at the end of Chapter XV).</p></div>

In other words, the greater the concentration of cupric-ion, the greater
its osmotic pressure must be, and the repelling electric force, required to overcome
the pressure of the cupric-ion, would be correspondingly greater.</p></div>

For elements that form <em class="italic">negative ions</em>, <em class="italic">e.g.</em> for
chlorine, bromine, oxygen, etc., the <em class="italic">equation reads</em> (see pp. <a href="#p273">273</a>,

<p>Note the <em class="italic">changed</em> sign of the expression on the right. The
difference in sign expresses the fact that, when negative ions
discharge on an electrode, they render it negative, and when they are
formed by an electrode, they leave the latter positive; for positive
ions, it will be recalled, the conditions are just the <em class="italic">reverse</em> (see
above).
</p>
<p>
Where a <em class="italic">soluble</em> element (<em class="italic">e.g.</em> chlorine) or a solution of a metal
(<em class="italic">e.g.</em> sodium amalgam) is used as an electrode, its concentration,
in general, is not constant, as in the case of a pure, solid metal
like copper (p. <a href="#p258">258</a>). In such cases, the quantity in the denominator
of the ratio in the logarithm cannot be expressed by a constant
K, but is expressed by K × C<sub>Element</sub>, C<sub>Element</sub> being used to
indicate the concentration of the element in the experiment in
question.</p></div>

The convention, adopted in the text, for the use of
the positive and negative signs in expressing potentials, is that
proposed by Luther (<em class="italic">cf.</em> Le Blanc's <em class="italic">Lehrbuch der Elektrochemie</em>
(third edition), p. 212). The <em class="italic">sign</em> always <em class="italic">denotes</em> the character
of the <em class="italic">charge</em> on the <em class="italic">first component</em> written in the subscript
to ε. Thus, for a copper plate in contact with a solution
of cupric sulphate, when C &gt; K, the logarithm, log(C / K), has a
<em class="italic">positive</em> value and ε<sub>Cu, CuSO<sub>4</sub></sub> is <em class="italic">positive</em>, which
means that the <em class="italic">metal</em> will be <em class="italic">positive</em>, the electrolyte negative.
For instance, for [Cu<sup>2+</sup>] = 1, ε<sub>Cu, CuSO<sub>4</sub></sub> is found to
be +0.606 (see the table at the end of Chapter XV).
ε<sub>Cu, CuSO<sub>4</sub></sub> = −ε<sub>CuSO<sub>4</sub>, Cu′</sub>. By this use of the signs
one is never in doubt as to their meaning. Unfortunately, widely
different definitions of the signs have been used (<em class="italic">cf.</em> Le
Blanc, <em class="italic">Electrochemistry</em> (1896), pp. 209, 219, and Lehfeldt,
<em class="italic">Electro-Chemistry</em> (1904), p. 159). Care must be taken, in using the
data of original papers, to be informed as to the definition used.
</p>
<p>
In accordance with the convention as to signs, adopted in this
book, the ratio of concentrations (C / K), used in the logarithm of
Nernst's formula, is the <em class="italic">reciprocal</em> of the ratio usually given. The
change has been made in order that the algebraic signs of the values
obtained from the application of the formula should be the same as
those observed in the experimental arrangements, as demanded by the
convention.</p></div>

When two electrodes are combined to form an electric
cell or couple, the potential difference of the couple is always the
(algebraic) <em class="italic">difference</em> of the two individual electrode potentials,
and hence these are <em class="italic">subtracted</em> from each other (algebraically). The
electrode of the first term of the difference (the minuend) is named
first in the subscript of the potential of the couple; then the sign
of the difference represents the character of the charge on that
electrode, in agreement with the convention (see footnote 2, p. <a href="#p261">261</a>). In illustration:
two copper electrodes may be taken, each of which, considered by
itself, carries a positive charge, because the concentrations of the cupric-ion
in the solutions bathing them are both greater than K; when they are combined,
each of the two electrodes will tend to send a positive current, in <em class="italic">opposite</em>
directions, into the metal connecting them. But the potential of the
electrode with the heavier charge (the one dipping into the solution containing
the greater concentration of cupric-ion) will overcome the potential of
the other electrode, and the current will flow, through the connecting metal,
with a potential that represents the difference between the two values. If
the electrode of the more concentrated solution is named first in the subscript
of the potential of the couple, its individual electrode-potential appears
as the first term of the difference (the minuend) and is reduced by the value
of the electrode-potential of the second electrode; as this is numerically
smaller than the value of the minuend, the difference will be positive, showing
that the electrode in the stronger solution, named first in the subscript of
the potential difference of the couple, carries a positive charge. Further, if
the second electrode dips into a solution, in which the concentration of the
cupric-ion is smaller than K, the logarithmic expression for its electrode-potential
will be found to give a negative value; and the (algebraic) subtraction
of this negative quantity from the electrode-potential of the first electrode
will give a larger potential difference, for the couple, than that possessed by
the first electrode alone—all of which agrees with the experimental results,
when such combinations are made.</p>

<p>Where negative elements are concerned, the same convention holds, but
the <em class="italic">logarithmic expression for the potential of such an electrode carries a negative
sign</em> (see footnote 1, p. <a href="#p261">261</a>), which must be inserted, algebraically, when the
expression is used as a term in the difference under discussion.</p></div>

The fact that this equilibrium relation has been proved
to hold for the action Fe<sup>2+</sup> ⇄ Fe<sup>3+</sup> and that it must be taken
into account in all oxidation-reduction reactions involving these
<em class="italic">ions</em>, in no wise excludes the possibility that other equilibrium
relations can also exist between ferrous and ferric compounds. For
instance, ferrous hydroxide Fe(OH)<sub>2</sub> may well have a characteristic
tendency of its own to assume a further positive charge (lose an
electron) according to Fe(OH)<sub>2</sub> ⇄ Fe(OH)<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>, the potential
of which action may, under given conditions, be a <em class="italic">main determining
factor</em> in the course of an action, <em class="italic">e.g.</em> in alkaline mixtures.
It is not impossible, even, that we also must consider negative
ions FeO<sub>2</sub><sup>2−</sup> and their tendency to be oxidized. Evidence would
<em class="italic">suggest</em> that ferrous hydroxide, <em class="italic">or its negative ion</em> FeO<sub>2</sub><sup>2−</sup>,
may have, indeed, a very <em class="italic">great tendency</em> to be oxidized, possibly
much greater than the tendency of Fe<sup>2+</sup> to form Fe<sup>3+</sup>. (<em class="italic">Cf.</em>

The potential of a solution of the iron salts is given by
ε = 0.058 log(10<sup>17</sup> × [Fe<sup>3+</sup>] / [Fe<sup>2+</sup>]).
In a solution of a ferric salt, if [Fe<sup>2+</sup>] = 0, the potential
would obviously be ∞, which could not present a condition
of equilibrium. Equilibrium is established in such a solution, as
will be shown further on in the text, by the liberation of chlorine
and the formation of ferro-salt, according to
2 Fe<sup>3+</sup> + 2 Cl<sup>−</sup> ⇄ 2 Fe<sup>2+</sup> + Cl<sub>2</sub>, until the potential,
resulting from the tendency
of chlorine to form chloride-ion, just balances the tendency of the
ferric-ion to form ferro-ion. But when a ferric chloride solution
is used as the source of supply of positive electricity, as in
the experiment described in the text, <em class="italic">both</em> the ferric-ion and
the chlorine tend to charge the platinum electrode with positive
electricity and to revert to a condition of equilibrium in reference
to their individual constants. The relations are much like those
between a cupric salt solution and a copper plate: if [Cu<sup>2+</sup>] &gt; K<sub>Cu<sup>2+</sup></sub>,
equilibrium will be established, as we have seen, by the
positive charging of the plate in sufficient degree to oppose the
tendency of the cupric-ion to discharge (see p. <a href="#p259">259</a>). But when the
solution and plate are used as the source of supply for an electric
current (p. <a href="#p264">264</a>), both the positive charge on the plate, and the
tendency of the cupric-ion to discharge and acquire the concentration
[Cu<sup>2+</sup>] = K<sub>Cu<sup>2+</sup></sub>, will supply the positive current. In
calculations we ignore the positive charge already deposited on the
plate and deal only with the concentration of Cu<sup>2+</sup>. The chlorine,
liberated in a solution of ferric chloride, plays practically the
same rôle as does the copper plate in a cupric salt solution, and
it can be ignored in the discussion of the combination described
in the text. In a ferrous salt solution, in a similar manner, some
ferric-ion must always be formed by liberation of hydrogen (see p.
<a href="#p282">282</a>), until equilibrium is reached according to
2 Fe<sup>2+</sup> + 2 H<sup>+</sup> ⇄ 2 Fe<sup>3+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>.
Hydrogen plays here the same rôle as chlorine does
in the ferric chloride solution.</p></div>

The constant is calculated from the data of Küster and
Crotogino on the potential of solutions of iodine in potassium iodide
[<em class="italic">Z. anorg. Chem.</em>, <em class="bold">23</em>, 88 (1900)]. Owing to the formation of
complex ions I<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, for which due allowance has not been made
in the calculation, and owing to some uncertainty as to the vague
definition of the concentration of iodine used, the estimation of
the constant can only be considered a rough one. The value given
expresses the order of the equilibrium ratio sufficiently well for
our present purposes. In a recent paper, Bray and MacKay [<em class="italic">J. Am.
Chem. Soc.</em>, <em class="bold">32</em>, 914 (1910)] have determined the constant
for the formation of the complex ion according to I<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> ⇄ I<sub>2</sub> +
I<sup>−</sup>, which might be used to correct the data of Küster and
Crotogino; but in view of other uncertainties and inaccuracies, the
correction has not been considered advisable.
</p>

<p> Several related methods may be used to calculate the equilibrium
constant for [I<sup>−</sup>]<sup>2</sup> : [I<sub>2</sub>] = K
from the data of Küster and Crotogino. Perhaps the simplest method
is the following: A solution of iodine ([I] = 1 / 32 normal, and
therefore [I<sub>2</sub>] = 1 / 64 molar) in 1/8 molar potassium
iodide, in which, the degree of ionization being taken into
account, [I<sup>−</sup>] = 0.109, was observed to show a potential
ε<sub>I<sub>2</sub>, I<sup>−</sup></sub> = +0.860 (the convention
as to signs, discussed on p. <a href="#p261">261</a>, is used here and the potential,
observed against a so-called "calomel electrode," is reduced to
the so-called "absolute potential"; <em class="italic">cf.</em>
Le Blanc, <em class="italic">Lehrbuch der Elektrochemie</em>,
p. <a href="#p214">214</a>). Now, <em class="italic">there must be a certain
concentration of iodide-ion</em>, which we will call [C], <em
class="italic">with which iodine</em> of the above concentration
<em class="italic">would be directly in equilibrium</em> and would
give no potential at all (<em class="italic">cf.</em> pp. <a href="#p261">261</a>
and 258 in regard to copper). With a change in the concentration
of the iodide-ion, a potential would be produced according to
ε<sub>I<sub>2</sub>, I<sup>−</sup></sub> = 0.0575 log([C] / [I<sup>−</sup>]).
This relation is of exactly the same nature as that developed
for the potential of copper plates, immersed in solutions of
cupric-ion of different concentrations (but see footnote 1, p.
<a href="#p261">261</a>, concerning the <em class="italic">sign</em> of the new
relation). In the present case, we are dealing with univalent
ions, I<sup>−</sup>, in place of bivalent ions Cu<sup>2+</sup>,
and the factor 0.0575 is used instead of 0.0575 / 2 (see p. <a href="#p261">261</a>).
If we insert the observed values, [I<sup>−</sup>] = 0.109 and
ε = 0.860, of the experiment described above, into the equation
ε<sub>I<sub>2</sub>, I<sup>−</sup></sub> = 0.0575 log([C] / [I<sup>−</sup>])
and solve the equation for [C], we find [C] = 10<sup>14</sup>.
<em class="italic">That means</em>, 1 / 64 molar iodine
<em class="italic">would be directly in equilibrium with a
concentration of iodide-ion</em> = 10<sup>14</sup> (if this
value is inserted for [I<sup>−</sup>] in the logarithmic
equation, the potential is found to be 0). For the condition of
equilibrium for I<sub>2</sub> ⇄ 2 I<sup>−</sup>, according to
[I<sup>−</sup>]<sup>2</sup> : [I<sub>2</sub>] = K, we have then
(10<sup>14</sup>)<sup>2</sup> : (1 / 64) = K = 6.4E29. Similarly, for
[I<sup>−</sup>] = 0.109 and [I<sub>2</sub>] = 1 / 512 the potential
ε = 0.831 is observed, and the equilibrium constant is found to be
5.1E29. When [I<sup>−</sup>] = 0.109 and [I<sub>2</sub>] = 1 / 128,
the potential is 0.850 and the constant is calculated to be 5.3E29.
The mean value for K is 5.6E29. In these calculations, the formation
of ions I<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, affecting the values for
[I<sup>−</sup>] and [I<sub>2</sub>], has not been considered, and
there is some doubt whether the concentrations of iodine, given by
Küster and Crotogino, do not represent [I<sub>2</sub>] rather than
[I], as assumed in the calculations. If the former be the case, the
mean value of the above experiments would be 2.8E29. The value, used
in the text, is considered sufficiently accurate for the purposes of
this book.</p></div>

This relation of the equilibrium constant and the solution-tension constants

constant for the oxidation of zinc by the cupric-ion, as given in footnote
1, on page <a href="#p267">267</a>. The <em class="italic">exact</em> value of the equilibrium constant is uncertain,
since K<sub>I<sup>−</sup>, Iodine</sub> has not yet been determined with a sufficient degree of
accuracy; but the value, used, gives the order of the constant sufficiently well
for our purposes, especially when it is considered in connection with the constant
given below for the same relation, when the chloride-ion is substituted
for the iodide-ion.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_552_575" href="#FNanchor_552_575" class="fnlabel">[552]</a>
This is the value of the constant as calculated from
the data given by Wilsmore (<em class="italic">Z. phys. Chem.</em>, <em class="bold">36</em>, 91 (1900))
for the solution-tension of chlorine under atmospheric pressure
at 18°. The calculation may be made exactly as in the case of the
similar constant for iodine (p. <a href="#p273">273</a>). <em class="italic">There must be a concentration
of chloride-ion</em>, which we will call [C], <em class="italic">with which chlorine, of
one atmosphere pressure at 18°</em>, would be directly in equilibrium.
The potential of chlorine, against any other concentration of
chloride-ion, would be ε<sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, Cl<sup>−</sup></sub> = 0.0575 log([C] / [Cl<sup>−</sup>]).
For [Cl<sup>−</sup>] = 1, ε is +1.694 (see the table at the end
of Chapter XV), and inserting these values in our equation and
solving it for [C], we find [C] = 2.88E29. That means, that chlorine,
at 18° and of atmospheric pressure, would be in equilibrium with
chloride-ion of the concentration given. Since chlorine, at this
temperature and pressure, has a concentration of 1 / 23.9 moles (at
18°, one mole is contained in 23.9 liters, instead of in 22.4 liters,
at O°), we have for the condition of equilibrium:
[Cl<sup>−</sup>]<sup>2</sup> : [Cl<sub>2</sub>] = (2.88E29)<sup>2</sup> : (1 / 23.9) = 2E60. [Cl<sub>2</sub>]
represents, thus, in the calculation
of this constant, the concentration of chlorine gas (see Chapter XV concerning
gas electrodes) and not the concentration of the dissolved chlorine; the latter,
however, is proportional to the gas concentration (Chapter VII).</p></div></div>

<p>We will turn now to the consideration of the question, how the
principles of the theory of electric oxidation and reduction may
be applied to the most important oxidizing agent, oxygen, and to
such vigorous and common oxidizing agents as permanganates,
dichromates, nitric acid, and similar substances.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Oxidation of Hydrogen by Oxygen.</h4>—The oxidation of hydrogen
by oxygen may be first considered, as representing a typical
and, in some respects, the most important case of oxidation by
oxygen. Hydrogen, like copper, zinc, and other elements, has a
certain tendency to form its ion, H<sup>+</sup>, and the latter, in turn, has a
tendency to be reduced to hydrogen. We may put H<sub>2</sub> ⇄ 2 H<sup>+</sup> and
the condition for equilibrium, at a given temperature, will be</div>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
[H<sup>+</sup>]<sup>2</sup> / [H<sub>2</sub>] = K<sub>H<sup>+</sup>, Hydrogen</sub>.
</div></div>

<p class="continue">In this equation [H<sub>2</sub>] represents the concentration of the hydrogen
in contact with the electrode (see below) and with the solution,
and [H<sup>+</sup>] represents the concentration of hydrogen-ion in
the solution bathing the electrode. The ionization of hydrogen,
at a given temperature, depends, according to this equation, on
<em class="italic">two variables</em>, the concentration, or pressure, of the gas and the
concentration, or osmotic pressure, of the hydrogen-ion in a given
solution.</p>

<p>If platinum gauze, coated with platinum black, is charged with
hydrogen, then, the greater the pressure of the gas, the more
soluble the hydrogen will be in the platinum (p. <a href="#p121">121</a>). Such a
charged gauze may be used as a hydrogen electrode (Fig. 13,
p. <a href="#p281">281</a>), the concentration of the hydrogen in which is proportional
to the concentration, or pressure, of the hydrogen gas surrounding
it; the platinum will allow of the ready transmission of electric
charges from and to the hydrogen dissolved in it. <a id="p278" class="xxpn">[p278]</a></p>

<p>The value of the constant<a id="FNanchor_553_586" href="#Footnote_553_586" class="fnanchor">553</a> K<sub>H<sup>+</sup>, Hydrogen</sub> = [H<sup>+</sup>]<sup>2</sup> / [H<sub>2</sub>], at 18°, is
found to be 5.55E−9, and <em class="italic">hydrogen, at 18°, under atmospheric
pressure, is directly in equilibrium with hydrogen-ion of the concentration</em>
[H<sup>+</sup>] = 1.52E−5.</p>

<p>If such an electrode, in contact with hydrogen of atmospheric
pressure, is dipped into the solution of some neutral salt, say
sodium chloride, in which the concentration of the hydrogen-ion,
formed by the ionization of water, at 18°, is 0.9E−7, which
is less than 1.5E−5, the hydrogen in the electrode must tend
to ionize more rapidly than it is formed from the ion, and the
<em class="italic">electrode must receive a negative charge</em>, exactly as in the case of zinc,
placed in a zinc sulphate solution.</p>

<p>For oxygen similar relations may be developed.<a id="FNanchor_554_587" href="#Footnote_554_587" class="fnanchor">554</a> We have:

<p>An electrode of platinum gauze, charged with oxygen under
atmospheric pressure, when dipped into the solution of a neutral
salt, <em class="italic">acquires a very strong positive charge</em>, the minute concentration
of hydroxide-ion, 0.9E−7, being very much smaller than the
value required by the constant, and the oxygen ionizing very
much more rapidly, in consequence, than it is formed by the discharge
of hydroxide ions (see p. <a href="#p259">259</a>). <a id="p280" class="xxpn">[p280]</a></p>

<p>When we combine the hydrogen and the oxygen electrodes, dipping
into a solution of sodium chloride, we find a current is, in fact,
established (the apparatus discussed on p. <a href="#p281">281</a> is used), and it flows
in the direction anticipated from the above development, the positive
current entering the voltmeter from the oxygen electrode.<a id="FNanchor_557_590" href="#Footnote_557_590" class="fnanchor">557</a></p>

<p>The potential of the hydrogen electrode, for a constant pressure
of hydrogen, is dependent on the concentration of hydrogen-ion
in the solution surrounding the electrode, exactly as the
potential of a copper plate, against a solution of cupric-ion, depends
on the concentration, or osmotic pressure, of cupric-ion in
the solution in which the plate is immersed. The concentration
of hydrogen-ion, in the present instance, is very small (0.9E−7,
at 18°), the solution being practically neutral; but the <em class="italic">addition of
an alkali</em> must reduce its concentration far below even this value,
since for water the product of the concentrations of hydrogen-ion
and hydroxide-ion is a constant (p. <a href="#p176">176</a>) and the increase
in the concentration of hydroxide-ion, produced by the addition
of alkali, must decrease the concentration of the hydrogen-ion
proportionally. We would expect, then, that the potential of
the hydrogen electrode must <em class="italic">increase</em>, when we add alkali to the
solution surrounding it, the hydrogen now ionizing against a
much smaller concentration of its ion. Such is in fact the case
(<em class="italic">exp.</em>), and the increase is found to be subject to a logarithmic
function for the relation between potential and the concentration
of the ion, similar to that found to hold for copper and its
ion.<a id="FNanchor_558_591" href="#Footnote_558_591" class="fnanchor">558</a> In the same way, the potential of the oxygen electrode
must depend on the concentration<a id="FNanchor_559_592" href="#Footnote_559_592" class="fnanchor">559</a> of the hydroxide-ion in the
solution bathing it. The addition of a strong acid, like sulphuric
acid, to this solution, by suppressing the hydroxide-ion,
small as its concentration is, should increase the potential of the
<a id="p281" class="xxpn">[p281]</a> electrode and the total potential of the cell. This, in fact, is the
case (<em class="italic">exp.</em>); the cell working under these conditions shows us
the largest potential yet observed.<a id="FNanchor_560_593" href="#Footnote_560_593" class="fnanchor">560</a></p>

<p>The arrangement of the apparatus and the course of the current are shown
in Fig. 14. The glass tube of the hydrogen electrode is connected with a
hydrogen generator, the tube of the oxygen electrode with a cylinder or
gasometer filled with oxygen. The hydrogen electrode is connected with
the negative post of the voltmeter, the oxygen electrode with the positive
post. Since the hydrogen ionizes, under the conditions used, more rapidly
than it is formed from the small concentration of the hydrogen ions surrounding
the hydrogen electrode, <em class="italic">hydrogen ions pass from the electrode into solution A</em>,
leaving a negative charge on the electrode; there is a migration of sodium
ions through the salt bridge (see p. <a href="#p254">254</a>) to solution B, and the hydrogen ions
formed combine with hydroxide ions and produce water. In a similar way,
<em class="italic">oxygen passes into solution B in the form of hydroxide ions</em> and these combine
with hydrogen ions of the sulphuric acid, forming water; SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> ions migrate
from the solution B through the salt bridge toward solution A and thus
prevent polarization (p. <a href="#p254">254</a>). While water is an actual product of the
action of the cell, working under these conditions, <em class="italic">the essential feature of the
oxidation of hydrogen is its ionization</em>—H<sub>2</sub> → 2 H<sup>+</sup>; it would be in the same
condition of oxidation if the hydrogen ions combined with any negative ions
other than HO<sup>−</sup>, or if they remained ions (as they would, if sodium chloride
surrounded the hydrogen electrode). Similarly, the essential feature of the
reduction of oxygen is its ionization in the form of HO<sup>−</sup> ions; in the present
<a id="p282" class="xxpn">[p282]</a> instance, these actually combine with hydrogen ions and form water, but the
reduction of oxygen would also be accomplished, if the hydroxide ions remained
ionized (as they would, if sodium chloride bathed the oxygen electrode). The
formation of water is the result of a union of ions, following the oxidation-reduction
reaction, which may be expressed in the following condensed form:</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Summary.</h4>—We thus find that the oxidation of hydrogen by
oxygen may be used to develop an electric current, exactly in the
same way as the other oxidation and reduction reactions, which
we have discussed, are found available for the same purpose. And
at a given temperature, the oxidation is subject to the influence
of analogous factors,—the solution-tension <em class="italic">constants, the concentrations
of the corresponding ions</em> in the solutions surrounding the
electrodes, and the <em class="italic">concentrations</em> of the <em class="italic">gases</em>.</div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Interpretation of Oxidation-Reduction Reactions in Terms of
the Oxygen-Hydrogen Gas Cell.</h4>—It is possible to interpret
all classes of reversible oxidations and reductions, carried out in
<em class="italic">aqueous</em> solutions, in terms of this so-called "oxygen-hydrogen
gas cell," if the assumption is made that <em class="italic">each oxidizing agent</em>,
such as nitric acid, permanganate, dichromate, etc., <em class="italic">has a tendency
to liberate</em>, either from its own molecules or by its action on
water, <em class="italic">oxygen of a definite concentration or pressure</em>, and that <em class="italic">each
reducing agent</em>, in turn, <em class="italic">has a tendency to liberate hydrogen</em>, from
water, <em class="italic">of a definite pressure or concentration</em>. The potential of
the oxygen-hydrogen cell is dependent on the concentrations of
the gases with which the electrodes are in contact:<a id="FNanchor_561_594" href="#Footnote_561_594" class="fnanchor">561</a> therefore,
each oxidation and reducing agent, yielding its own characteristic
concentration of oxygen or hydrogen, respectively, would have <em class="italic">a
characteristic constant</em>, corresponding to the solution-tension constants
of the elements and measuring its oxidizing or reducing
power. This interpretation of oxidation-reduction reactions has received
extended attention and recognition. The study, just made,
of the oxidation of hydrogen by oxygen, sufficiently suggests the
treatment of oxidation and reduction from this viewpoint.</div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Interpretation of Oxidation-Reduction Reactions in Terms
of Direct Transfers of Electric Charges.</h4>—In the study of the
<a id="p283" class="xxpn">[p283]</a> oxidation of zinc by cupric-ion,
Zn ↓ + Cu<sup>2+</sup> ⥂ Cu ↓ + Zn<sup>2+</sup>, of
the oxidation of iodides and sulphides by ferric salts,
2 Fe<sup>3+</sup> + 2 I<sup>−</sup> ⥂ 2 Fe<sup>2+</sup> + I<sub>2</sub>, and 2 Fe<sup>3+</sup> + S<sup>2−</sup> ⥂ 2 Fe<sup>2+</sup> + S↓, and of
similar actions, it has been possible to represent the oxidation-reduction
actions as the result of <em class="italic">direct transfers of electric charges</em>
between atoms and their ions.<a id="FNanchor_562_595" href="#Footnote_562_595" class="fnanchor">562</a> In the following discussions, the
attempt will be made to interpret, in the same terms, the oxidizing
power of the most important remaining oxidizing agents, which
include such compounds as nitric, permanganic, chromic, arsenic
and similar oxygen acids. The interpretation will avoid the
assumption of the liberation of oxygen and hydrogen, under hypothetical,<a id="FNanchor_563_596" href="#Footnote_563_596" class="fnanchor">563</a>
and, sometimes, enormous pressures, as <em class="italic">intermediate
products</em> in the actions.</div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Arsenic Acid as an Oxidizing Agent.</h4>—Arsenic acid is occasionally
used as an oxidizing agent (<em class="italic">e.g.</em> in the aniline-dye industry),
and, although it is not a very powerful one, its study is
of theoretical interest. If to a solution of potassium arseniate
some potassium iodide is added, practically no iodine is liberated
(<em class="italic">exp.</em>). If dilute hydrochloric acid, in excess, is added to this
mixture, iodine is slowly liberated (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). But the addition of
concentrated hydrochloric acid causes iodine to be liberated at
once in very large amounts (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). We may ask in what way the
<a id="p284" class="xxpn">[p284]</a> addition of the concentrated acid causes such a decided difference
in the ease and speed with which arsenic acid oxidizes the iodide-ion
to free iodine and is reduced, in turn, to arsenious acid and its
derivatives.<a id="FNanchor_564_597" href="#Footnote_564_597" class="fnanchor">564</a></div>

<p>We may recall the fact that a solution of potassium arseniate, to
which dilute hydrochloric acid has been added, will remain clear for
some time when the mixture is saturated with hydrogen sulphide (<em
class="italic">exp.</em>). If a considerable excess of concentrated
hydrochloric acid is added to this mixture, hydrogen sulphide
immediately forms a dense precipitate (<em class="italic">exp.</em>)
of arsenic <em class="italic">pentasulphide</em>—presumably through
the union of quinquivalent arsenic-ion with the sulphide-ion:
2 As<sup>5+</sup> + 5 S<sup>2−</sup> ⇄ As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub> ↓
(see p. <a href="#p247">247</a>). This behavior suggested that arsenic acid,
although a moderately strong acid, might nevertheless be
<em class="italic">somewhat amphoteric</em>, might have <em
class="italic">slight</em> basic properties, as well as its
ordinary acid functions. The relation is expressed in the
equations:<a id="FNanchor_565_598" href="#Footnote_565_598"
class="fnanchor">565</a></p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
<span class="ibnowrap">
3 H<sup>+</sup> + AsO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup> ⇄ (HO)<sub>3</sub>AsO
<br />
(HO)<sub>3</sub>AsO + HOH ⇄ As(OH)<sub>5</sub> ⥃ As<sup>5+</sup> + 5 HO<sup>−</sup>.
</span></div></div>

<p>Since oxidations by arsenic acid involve its reduction to
arsenious acid, containing <em class="italic">trivalent</em>,<a
id="FNanchor_566_599" href="#Footnote_566_599"
class="fnanchor">566</a> in place of <em class="italic">quinquivalent
arsenic</em>, one might well suspect, that the <em
class="italic">oxidizing component</em> is the <em
class="italic">quinquivalent arsenic-ion</em>, As<sup>5+</sup>,
<em class="italic">the discharge of two of whose positive charges
would cause oxidation</em> (<em class="italic">e.g.</em> of
iodide-ion), exactly as the discharge of positive charges at the
positive pole of an electric current causes oxidation (p. <a href="#p252">252</a>):
As<sup>5+</sup> + 2 I<sup>−</sup> ⥂ As<sup>3+</sup> + I<sub>2</sub>.
<a id="p285" class="xxpn">[p285]</a></p>

<p>In a solution of potassium arseniate, we would have only the
faintest trace of the ion As<sup>5+</sup>, since the addition of an alkali
to the system, expressed in the above equations, would carry the
reversible reactions towards the left. The addition of dilute
hydrochloric acid to the system must carry the reactions towards
the right and <em class="italic">increase</em> the concentration of As<sup>5+</sup>; the addition
of concentrated acid must increase the concentration of As<sup>5+</sup>
very much more. Even if the concentration of As<sup>5+</sup> remained
minute, the oxidizing power would be increased proportionally
to the <em class="italic">ratio</em> of the concentrations in the first and the last solutions.
A millionfold increase in concentration, even when we are dealing
with very small numbers, would imply a millionfold increase in
the activity of the solution. If, then, the <em class="italic">oxidizing component of
arsenic acid</em> is the <em class="italic">quinquivalent ion</em>, As<sup>5+</sup>, which would tend
to discharge two of its positive (oxidizing) charges, arsenic acid
should be a much more powerful oxidizing agent in strong acid
solution than in alkaline or neutral solutions.</p>

<p>We thus arrive at the conclusion that the addition of hydrochloric
acid to a mixture of arseniate and iodide may be effective,
in bringing about the reduction of the arseniate and the oxidation
of the iodide, <em class="italic">primarily because of its action on arsenic acid</em>, perhaps
by facilitating its ionization as a base, and that it is not effective
through any action on the iodide, for instance by producing free
hydroiodic acid, as is often assumed. This conclusion may easily
be tested with the aid of the chemometer (see p. <a href="#p253">253</a>): potassium
arseniate against potassium iodide gives only the faintest possible
current, barely perceptible with the aid of a very sensitive voltmeter.<a id="FNanchor_567_600" href="#Footnote_567_600" class="fnanchor">567</a>
The addition of hydrochloric acid to the beaker containing
the potassium iodide does <em class="italic">not increase</em> the potential (it rather
decreases it somewhat), whereas the addition of the concentrated
acid to the potassium arseniate solution <em class="italic">produces a most decided
increase in the potential</em><a id="FNanchor_568_601" href="#Footnote_568_601" class="fnanchor">568</a> (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). It is evident, therefore, that the
addition of the acid is primarily and directly <em class="italic">intended to increase
the oxidizing power of the arsenic acid</em>, rather than to increase the
reducing power of the iodide. <a id="p286" class="xxpn">[p286]</a></p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p>The more common methods of expressing oxidation-reduction reactions of
this type are illustrated in the following equations:</p>

<div class="chemathbox" id="eqp286"><div class="EquationWLable">
<div class="ibnowrap">Na<sub>3</sub>AsO<sub>4</sub> + 2 HI ⇄ Na<sub>3</sub>AsO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + I<sub>2</sub>

<div class="equationlabel">(2)</div>
</div>

<p class="continue">Both of these forms of expression give the net results of the action correctly.
Neither attempts to interpret the interesting and important fact that the
reduction of arsenic acid is facilitated by the presence of acids (of hydrogen-ion).
It is, at least, also <em class="italic">permissible</em> to consider As<sup>5+</sup> ions to be present
and to express the oxidation-reduction reaction with the aid of this conception,<a id="FNanchor_570_603" href="#Footnote_570_603" class="fnanchor">570</a>
as has been done in the previous discussion. In the final analysis, this

valences<a id="FNanchor_571_604" href="#Footnote_571_604" class="fnanchor">571</a>

and it also expresses, clearly and definitely, the relation of the hydrogen-ion
to the action.<a href="#Footnote_571_604" class="fnanchor">571</a> The following case furnishes an illustration as to how the new
point of view works out from the standpoint of a quantitative study of an
oxidation-reduction reaction of this type<a id="FNanchor_572_605" href="#Footnote_572_605" class="fnanchor">572</a>: uranyl salts, such as the sulphate
UO<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, are oxidizing reagents, which are readily reduced, particularly in acid
solutions, to uranous salts (<em class="italic">e.g.</em> to the sulphate, U(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>). The potential of a
mixture of uranyl and uranous salts is found<a id="FNanchor_573_606" href="#Footnote_573_606" class="fnanchor">573</a> to depend on the action expressed
in the equation UO<sub>2</sub><sup>2+</sup> + 4 H<sup>+</sup> + 2 ⊖ ⇄ U<sup>4+</sup> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O. For the condition

<p class="continue">The value of this constant, at 18°, is found, by calculation,<a id="FNanchor_574_607" href="#Footnote_574_607" class="fnanchor">574</a> to be approximately

<div class="h4p"><h4>Permanganic Acid, Chromic Acids, etc., as Oxidizing Agents.</h4>—We
may extend the same views to the oxidizing power of such important
agents as permanganic, dichromic, and nitric acids. In
each case we may assume that the oxidizing component is a highly
charged positive ion, <em class="italic">e.g.</em> in the case of KMnO<sub>4</sub> a septavalent manganese-ion,
Mn<sup>7+</sup>, whose oxidizing power will depend on its
tendency to discharge part of its heavy positive electrical charge
and whose efficiency, in accordance with the law of equilibrium,
will also be proportional to the concentration, in which the highly
charged ion is present. Permanganate is used as a favorite oxidizing
agent in the laboratory, for instance, in the oxidation of
ferrous to ferric salts in quantitative analysis; the action proceeds
quantitatively and rapidly in acid solution, and the end of the
action is recognized by the fact that the intense pink color of the
permanganate is not destroyed (<em class="italic">exp.</em>). <a id="p288" class="xxpn">[p288]</a></div>

<p>If we bring permanganate, against potassium iodide, into the
beakers of the chemometer (p. <a href="#p253">253</a>), we find that it is a much more
vigorous oxidizing agent than is arsenic acid, and again we find
that the addition of acid (sulphuric) to the permanganate solution
enormously increases the potential (<em class="italic">exp.</em>) and therefore its oxidizing
power. The addition of an acid would, obviously, enormously
increase the concentration of a positive septavalent ion, if permanganic
acid is assumed to be, to a slight extent, <em class="italic">base forming</em>
and therefore amphoteric:</p>

to produce an electric current by using one of these common,
powerful oxidizing agents in aqueous solution, just as it is possible
with oxygen and with the simpler agents discussed earlier. Whatever
the theory of the formation of the current, whether we are
dealing, in the last cases considered, with acids which have the
capacity to ionize minimally as bases, forming highly charged
positive ions, whose discharge involves an oxidation of the substance
receiving the discharged electricity, or whether we accept
the view that oxygen is liberated by them in exceedingly concentrated
form and tends to form in aqueous solutions the
hydroxide-ion, HO<sup>−</sup>, unquestionably the closest possible relation
has been established between oxidation-reduction reactions and
electrical relations, as formulated on the basis of the theory of
ionization. In all cases, at a constant temperature, as demanded
by the law of mass action, the net result of an action will depend
on <em class="italic">constant factors</em>, measuring the tendencies of atoms to assume
or lose electric charges (electrons), and on <em class="italic">variable factors</em>, the
concentrations of the reacting components.</div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Oxidation of Organic Compounds.</h4>—In conclusion, it may
be asked whether <em class="italic">the oxidation of organic compounds</em> may also
be brought into relation with electrical charges and interpreted
on the basis of the theory which has been presented. For this
purpose we may study the oxidation of one of the simplest of
organic compounds, formaldehyde CH<sub>2</sub>O, which forms the active
component in solutions of <em class="italic">formalin</em>. Formaldehyde is also intimately
related to some of the most important food products,
the carbohydrates, whose oxidation is utilized in the animal
economy. It is formed<a id="FNanchor_578_611" href="#Footnote_578_611" class="fnanchor">578</a> in the green leaves of plants by the
<a id="p290" class="xxpn">[p290]</a> reduction of carbon dioxide, absorbed from the atmosphere, with the
aid of the energy of the sun's light: CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O → CH<sub>2</sub>O + O<sub>2</sub>. It is
readily condensed, forming glucose (6 CH<sub>2</sub>O → C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>), cane sugar
C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>, and still more complex carbohydrates, such as starch.</div>

<p>Formaldehyde, like other aldehydes, is readily oxidized. A
favorite reagent, used in oxidizing it, is an ammoniacal solution of
silver nitrate (<em class="italic">exp.</em>), the separation of silver from such a solution
being a characteristic reaction of aldehydes. The reagent is rendered
still more sensitive by the addition of sodium or potassium
hydroxide.<a id="FNanchor_579_612" href="#Footnote_579_612" class="fnanchor">579</a> We may ask how we would interpret, from the point
of view of the electric theory of oxidation and reduction, the oxidation
of formaldehyde and the reduction of silver nitrate to silver,
under these conditions. According to the theory, the oxidizing
agent in silver nitrate is the silver-ion, the discharge of which
gives positive electricity, which the oxidized substance, the formaldehyde,
must absorb. But in a silver nitrate solution there is
a far larger concentration of the silver-ion than in an ammoniacal
solution (p. <a href="#p220">220</a>), containing the same total concentration of
silver. The complex silver-ammonium-ion Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>, it may be
recalled, is a rather stable one,<a id="FNanchor_580_613" href="#Footnote_580_613" class="fnanchor">580</a> and, consequently, the addition of
ammonia to silver nitrate should decidedly <em class="italic">weaken</em> its oxidizing
power. Still, the practical use of ammonia, especially in combination
with sodium hydroxide, is found to be most effective.
We are led to suspect that, in spite of the untoward effect of
ammonia on the oxidizing power of the silver compound, an <em class="italic">alkaline</em>
solution is desirable for the sake of the effect of the alkali
on formaldehyde, the reducing substance involved. To follow up
this conclusion, we must next consider, in some detail, the nature of
formaldehyde; we shall presently find that the conclusion, which
we have just reached, as to the probably favorable effect of alkali
on the <em class="italic">reducing power</em> of formaldehyde, will be verified by experiments,
which the consideration of formaldehyde will suggest.</p>

<p>The oxidation of formaldehyde may most clearly be formulated
on the basis of views, developed by Nef, on the formation of
methylene<a id="FNanchor_581_614" href="#Footnote_581_614"
class="fnanchor">581</a> derivatives, containing bivalent
carbon atoms. A solution <a id="p291" class="xxpn">[p291]</a>
of formalin contains formaldehyde in a variety of forms, in a
very complex condition of equilibrium. Of these compounds, the
aldehyde, CH<sub>2</sub>O, probably exists in two forms, which
have the same composition and molecular weight, but which differ
in the arrangement of the atoms in the molecules (in the <em
class="italic">structure</em> of the molecules); we probably have
CH<sub>2</sub>═O ⥃ CH(OH), the former of which (CH<sub>2</sub>═O)
is, most likely, by far the more stable and the chief one of these
two substances, present under ordinary conditions. The second
compound CH(OH) may be present in traces only. One difference, we
note, lies in the position of one of the hydrogen atoms in the
respective molecules; the second form contains a hydroxide group
(OH), which gives it the properties of an acid and renders it capable
of forming salts CH(OMe) with bases. But the molecule of this second
form also would <em class="italic">contain a carbon atom, only two
of whose valences are satisfied</em> (by H and OH), two of the
ordinary four valences of a carbon atom being thus left free or
<em class="italic">unsaturated</em>. We may indicate the two free
carbon valences in the formula ═CH(OH). <em class="italic">Such an
unsaturated, bivalent carbon atom</em> ═C <em class="italic">would
be particularly sensitive to oxidation</em>.<a id="FNanchor_582_615"
href="#Footnote_582_615" class="fnanchor">582</a></p>

<p>Besides these two forms, a formalin solution also contains
a polymerized form, probably (CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>,
which in dilute solution, or under the influence
of heat, slowly breaks down into formaldehyde,
(CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub> ⇄ 2 CH<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

<p>The addition of alkali to the mixture probably leads to the
formation of the salt ═CH(OMe), thus disturbing all the conditions
of equilibrium and <em class="italic">leading to the transformation of a very
much larger part of the aldehyde into a compound containing the
characteristic unsaturated (bivalent) carbon</em>, than was originally
present. The aldehyde will thus become <em class="italic">more susceptible to oxidation</em>
as a result of the enormous increase in the concentration
of the oxidizable component. We may assume this to be either
the salt, ═CH(OMe), or its negative ion, ═CH(O<sup>−</sup>), or both, or
some analogous derivative. Further, the two free valences of a
bivalent carbon atom may be considered to consist of a positive
and a negative charge of electricity, either actual or potential,<a id="FNanchor_583_616" href="#Footnote_583_616" class="fnanchor">583</a>
and <em class="italic">the oxidation</em> will consist
<a id="p292" class="xxpn">[p292]</a> <em class="italic">primarily in the absorption of two
positive charges, from the oxidizing agent, to convert the negative
charge on the carbon atom</em>, say in ±CH(ONa), <em class="italic">into a positive charge</em>.<a id="FNanchor_584_617" href="#Footnote_584_617" class="fnanchor">584</a>
If the oxidizing agent is alkaline silver nitrate solution, we may
formulate the successive actions as follows:</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
(NaO)HC± + 2 Ag<sup>+</sup> → (NaO)HC<sup>2+</sup> + 2 Ag ↓.
</div></div>

<p class="continue">The two positive silver ions correspond to two negative ions, <em class="italic">e.g.</em>
hydroxide ions HO<sup>−</sup>, which are set free by the discharge of the
silver ions, and which, in turn, will combine with the oxidized
carbon atom holding the two positive charges:</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
(NaO)HC<sup>2+</sup> + 2 HO<sup>−</sup> → (NaO)HC(OH)<sub>2</sub> → (NaO)HC:O + H<sub>2</sub>O.
</div></div>

<p class="continue">The salt formed, HCO<sub>2</sub>Na, is <em class="italic">sodium formate</em>, which is the first
isolated product of the oxidation of formaldehyde.</p>

<p>It would appear, from this point of view, that the <em class="italic">alkaline nature</em>
of the silver nitrate mixture is advantageous primarily because
a base is required by the formaldehyde, the reducing agent, to
convert it into some readily oxidizable form. And the proved
efficiency of the alkaline mixture (see above) makes it appear
probable that the advantage gained by this result <em class="italic">more than offsets
the loss in oxidizing power</em>, suffered by the silver nitrate following
the suppression of its real oxidizing component, the silver-ion,
when, in the presence of ammonia, the latter is converted largely
into the ion, Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>. Ammonia, in turn, is employed in the
oxidizing mixture, essentially with the object of preventing the
precipitation of the silver-ion, as silver oxide, by the hydroxide-ion
of an alkaline mixture. These conclusions, as well as, in
particular, the <em class="italic">main conception</em> <em class="bold">that in the oxidation of formaldehyde
there is an actual transfer of electrical charges</em>, may be
fully confirmed with the aid of the chemometer.<a id="FNanchor_585_618" href="#Footnote_585_618" class="fnanchor">585</a></p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<p><em class="smcap">Exp.</em> A small beaker, containing a platinum electrode, which is connected
with the positive post of the voltmeter, is half filled with a solution of silver
and sodium nitrates. A similar small beaker, containing a platinum electrode
leading to the negative post of the voltmeter, is charged with a solution
of sodium nitrate (to render the solution a good conductor) and with
some formalin. The solutions in the two beakers are connected by means of
a salt-bridge containing sodium nitrate. <a id="p293" class="xxpn">[p293]</a></p></div>

<p>Only a <em class="italic">very slight</em> current is produced under these conditions;
the potential between silver nitrate and formaldehyde is found to
be <em class="italic">extremely</em> small. If, now, sodium hydroxide is added to the
formalin mixture, an <em class="italic">enormous increase</em> in potential is observed,
proving, unmistakably, that the addition of the alkali to the formalin
solution <em class="italic">enormously increases the concentration of the reacting,
oxidizable component</em>.<a id="FNanchor_586_619" href="#Footnote_586_619" class="fnanchor">586</a></p>

<p>When some ammonia is added to the silver nitrate mixture, we
find, as anticipated, that the <em class="italic">oxidizing power of the silver solution
is greatly reduced</em>, the silver-ion being converted into the complex
ion, Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>; but the potential is still very much <em class="italic">greater</em> than
the potential between silver nitrate and formalin without any
alkali—which shows that the advantage of using alkali with the
formaldehyde greatly outweighs the disadvantage of using ammonia
with the silver nitrate.</p>

<p>An electric current may also be readily obtained by combining
alkaline formaldehyde with other oxidizing agents—for instance
with an <em class="italic">oxygen</em> electrode (p. <a href="#p279">279</a>). We find (<em class="italic">exp.</em>) that the oxidation
proceeds with remarkable ease under these conditions. Permanganate,
dichromate, etc., may be substituted for oxygen, with the
same general result.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Summary.</h4>—It is clear, then, that the oxidation of an <em class="italic">organic
substance</em> may readily be interpreted as consisting, ultimately, in
a transfer of electrical charges, of exactly the same nature, as is
found in the other oxidation reactions which we have considered,
<a id="p294" class="xxpn">[p294]</a> and that the conditions for producing a maximum current, as
investigated with the aid of the chemometer, give us, again,
important guidance in following the course of the reactions. It
is needless to say that the oxidation of other organic compounds,
such as glucose, alcohol, etc., may be profitably studied from the
same point of view.</div>

<p>It also follows, from the conclusions reached, that, under proper
experimental conditions, electricity, in the form of a current, must
be capable of effecting the oxidation, or the reduction, of organic
as well as inorganic compounds (p. <a href="#p252">252</a>). Extended investigations
have, indeed, shown that electric currents belong to the most important
and efficient agents for this purpose, because the oxidation, or
the reduction, of the organic compound becomes susceptible to the
most exact control through the regulation of the potentials used.<a id="FNanchor_587_620" href="#Footnote_587_620" class="fnanchor">587</a></p>

<p>The potential differences, given in the table, are based on the assumption
that the <em class="italic">absolute zero</em> of potential is at such a point, that the so-called standard
normal calomel electrode has a value of +0.56 volt relative to this zero
(<em class="italic">cf.</em> Ostwald, <em class="italic">Z. phys. Chem.</em>, <em class="bold">36</em>, 97 (1901)). The exact determination of this
value is a very difficult matter. Recently Palmaer (<em class="italic">ibid.</em>, <em class="bold">59</em>, 129 (1907)),
located the absolute zero at a point 0.04 volt more positive than the above,
making the absolute potential of the normal calomel electrode, approximately,
+0.52 volt. To refer potentials, given in this book, to this new zero, one
would subtract 0.04 volt from all positive potentials and add 0.04 to the numbers
representing negative potentials (<em class="italic">e.g.</em> E. P.<sub>Zn,Zn<sup>2+</sup></sub> would become −0.569
in place of −0.529 volt). Since the <em class="italic">equilibrium (solution-tension) constants</em>
are calculated from the potential differences referred to the absolute zero
(p. <a href="#p259">259</a>), any change in the zero involves corresponding changes in the values
of the equilibrium constants, as calculated for this book. However, it should
be noted that all potential differences would be corrected by the same constant
quantity (0.04 volt for Palmaer's zero): <em class="italic">all the equilibrium constants for
univalent metallic ions would be increased proportionally to a constant factor</em> <em class="italic">c</em>
(<em class="italic">c</em> is very nearly equal to 5, for Palmaer's zero), the equilibrium constants
for bivalent metallic ions would be increased proportionally to <em class="italic">c</em><sup>2</sup>, etc. <em class="italic">The
equilibrium ratio</em> for two metals and their ions <em class="italic">would in no wise be changed</em>
by these alterations: <em class="italic">e.g.</em> for the equilibrium between zinc and copper and
<a id="p296" class="xxpn">[p296]</a> their ions (p. <a href="#p267">267</a>), K<sub>equil.</sub> = K<sub>Zn<sup>2+</sup></sub> / K<sub>Cu<sup>2+</sup></sub>; the factor <em class="italic">c</em><sup>2</sup> would be introduced
into both terms of the ratio and would not affect the value of the
latter. For the condition of equilibrium between silver and copper and
their ions (p. <a href="#p267">267</a>)
K<sub>equil.</sub> = K<sub>Ag<sup>+</sup></sub><sup>2</sup> / K<sub>Cu<sup>2+</sup></sub>,
and since <span class="ibnowrap">(<em class="italic">c</em>)</span><sup>2</sup> = <em class="italic">c</em><sup>2</sup>, this equilibrium
ratio would also not be affected. For elements, which produce negative
ions, the corresponding correction factors would be 1 / <em class="italic">c</em>, 1 / <em class="italic">c</em><sup>2</sup>, etc.,
and the
equilibrium relations between two such elements and their ions likewise would
remain unchanged. Since these <em class="italic">equilibrium relations</em> are the <em class="italic">significant</em> ones
in this work, and since our conclusions have been based on them, it is clear
that a change in the absolute zero would not affect the conclusions reached.</p>

<p>On account of the uncertainty attaching to the determination of the absolute
zero of potential, it is preferred, in practice, to report the experimentally
determined potentials as measured against a constant, well-defined electrode
(such as the calomel electrode or a hydrogen electrode) and thus to eliminate
the variation, which a change in the determination of the zero potential
would make necessary. However, for an elementary discussion of oxidation-reduction
reactions, from the same viewpoint as is used in considering all
other reversible chemical actions, the idea of the absolute potential has certain
advantages, making a uniform treatment possible.</p>

The concentration of hydrogen, and of the non-metallic elements

value only when the concentration of the element is defined (see

For hydrogen we have H<sub>2</sub> ⇄ 2 H<sup>+</sup>. The
first table tells us that hydrogen, at 18° under atmospheric
pressure, is in equilibrium with its ion when the concentration
of hydrogen-ion is 1.52E−5 (under K<sub>Ion</sub>). Now, a mole
of hydrogen at 18° occupies 22.4 × 291 / 273 = 23.9 liters
under atmospheric pressure, and its concentration (per liter)
is therefore 1 / 23.9 mole. Then equilibrium exists, when
[H<sub>2</sub>] = 1 / 23.9 and [H<sup>+</sup>] = 1.52E−5 and
K<sub>equil.</sub> = [H<sup>+</sup>]<sup>2</sup> : [H<sub>2</sub>] = (1.52E−5)<sup>2</sup> × 23.9 = 5.6E−9.</p>

These constants are calculated from data given in
Wilsmore's tables (<em class="italic">loc. cit.</em>) on the solution tension of hydrogen.
Hydrogen, at 18° under one atmosphere pressure, produces a potential
of ε<sub>H<sub>2</sub>, H<sup>+</sup></sub> = +0.277 (see p. <a href="#p261">261</a>, in regard to the sign)
against a solution containing hydrogen-ion in a concentration
[H<sup>+</sup>] = 1 (see the table at the end of this chapter). Now, there
must be some concentration of hydrogen-ion, which we will call
[C], with which hydrogen at 18° and 760 mm. pressure is directly
in equilibrium, with the potential 0. For any concentration of
hydrogen-ion [H<sup>+</sup>], <em class="italic">other than</em> [C], a potential is produced
according to ε<sub>H<sub>2</sub>, H<sup>+</sup></sub> = 0.0575 log([H<sup>+</sup>] / [C]). If
we insert into this equation the values [H<sup>+</sup>] = 1 and the
potential ε = +0.277, and if we solve the equation for [C], we
find [C] = 1.52E−5. That is the concentration of H<sup>+</sup>, with
which hydrogen of one atmosphere pressure at 18° is directly in
equilibrium. Since under these conditions of temperature and pressure
[H<sub>2</sub>] = 1 / 23.9 mole, we have for the condition of <em class="italic">equilibrium</em>

The most convenient form of electrode for this purpose
consists (see Fig. 14) of a cylinder (about one inch long) of
platinum gauze, which is fused to a glass tube and connected with a
wire leading through the tube to some mercury, held in a small branch
tube, fused into the main tube near its upper end. The gas is easily
conducted to the platinum gauze electrode through such a tube. The
cylinder of platinum gauze may be made by joining the ends of rolled
gauze with pieces of molten glass. It is coated with platinum black.</p></div>

Fredenhagen, <em class="italic">Z. anorg. Chem.</em>, <em class="bold">29</em>, 424
(1902), has brought interesting experimental evidence of the
charging of an electrode with <em class="italic">gaseous oxygen</em>, when ferric-ion
is the oxidizing agent in aqueous solutions. Whether the oxygen,
which is liberated by the action of the ferric-ion on water,
4 Fe<sup>3+</sup> + 4 HO<sup>−</sup> ⇄ 4 Fe<sup>2+</sup> + O<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O, is always <em class="italic">the
intermediate product and the direct oxidizing agent</em> in aqueous
solution, can hardly be considered decided by the experiment—it
may well be the product of a <em class="italic">parallel action</em>, which must take
place to a certain extent, according to the laws of equilibrium,
in a system containing both Fe<sup>3+</sup> and HO<sup>−</sup> ions. The result
hardly proves that oxygen must be the intermediate product in the
<em class="italic">main action</em>, when ferric ions act as the oxidizing agent. We may
consider, for instance, a solution containing an iodide and a ferric
salt: iodide ions have a far smaller affinity for their negative
charges (electrons) than hydroxide ions have, and, consequently,
will transfer their negative charges (electrons) more readily to the
ferric ions than the hydroxide ions would. The action, if oxygen were
<em class="italic">first</em> liberated, would lead to the same ultimate result, but the
observation made by Fredenhagen would not prove that the main action
would not nevertheless go by the shorter direct path rather than
through an intermediate formation of oxygen.</p></div>

In other instances, the action of the hydrogen-ion in

The oxidation occurs essentially in the same manner
as described (p, 292) for the action of formaldehyde on ammoniacal
silver solution, when they are brought together in a single vessel.
In the present case, where the action is used to produce an electric
current, there is a <em class="italic">migration</em> of <em class="italic">negative ions</em> into the formalin
solution through the salt-bridge (p. <a href="#p254">254</a>). For every two silver

two hydroxide ions are liberated in the formaldehyde solution, as a
result of this migration, and they combine with the oxidized carbon
atom. The oxidation may be expressed, then, simply as follows:

SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS FOR ACID IONS</h3>

<div class="xxpn"><a id="p299" class="xxpn">[p299]</a>
<a href="#Contents">TOC</a></div>

<p>The systematic analysis for acid ions is made on a plan differing
in an important particular from the systematic analysis for metal
ions. The latter, as has been seen, are divided into groups, which,
by precipitation or solution of characteristic salts, are successively
separated from subsequent groups, before the isolated groups are
analyzed. That is, in general, a group of metal ions is examined
in the absence of the ions of all other groups. Acid ions are also
divided into groups, but, as a rule, the groups are not separated
from each other for analysis. The reason for this difference in
procedure is found, chiefly, in the fact that foreign acid ions interfere<a id="FNanchor_589_622" href="#Footnote_589_622" class="fnanchor">589</a>
to a smaller degree with the specific tests for the ions of a
group, than is the case in the analysis for metal ions.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Grouping of Acid Ions.</h4>—While there is general agreement,
among the most important systems of analysis, in the grouping of
metal ions, there is notable variation in the way in which acids are
grouped by different authors. We shall confine ourselves here to
the consideration of two different modes of general procedure and
not discuss differences in minor details.</div>

<p>If acids were present only in the form of the free acids or of
their alkali salts, the division into groups could naturally and
profitably be made to include groups, which are identified by
reactions carried out in <em class="italic">neutral</em> or <em class="italic">alkaline</em> solution, as well as by
such as are made in <em class="italic">acid</em> solutions. Now, cations other than the
alkali ions are liable to interfere with tests designed for alkaline
or neutral solutions. For instance, a group of acid ions, in which
the phosphate-ion is included, is characterized by the fact that the
acids form barium salts, which are soluble in acid but not in
neutral or alkaline solutions. The absence or presence of such a
group may be recognized, if no cations other than the alkali metal
ions are present, by the addition of barium chloride to the solution
and by careful neutralization of any free acid, by ammonium
<a id="p300" class="xxpn">[p300]</a> hydroxide. Barium phosphate and the barium salts of the other
acids of the group will be precipitated, if their ions are present.
It is clear, however, that a number of metal ions must interfere
with the test. For instance, a solution of aluminium nitrate
or of ferric chloride, treated with barium chloride, and with ammonium
hydroxide to neutralize the acid present in the solution
as a result of the hydrolysis of the salt, would give a precipitate
of aluminium hydroxide or of ferric hydroxide, and <em class="italic">not of barium
salts</em>. The formation of a precipitate under these conditions evidently
will not constitute any basis whatever for reaching a conclusion
as to the presence or absence of acid ions, such as can form
precipitates of barium salts under the same circumstances.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Systematic Analysis for Acid Ions, Based on the Removal of
Metal Ions other than the Alkali Metal Ions.</h4>—On account of
this kind of interference, by cations other than those of the alkali
group, with a number of group and specific tests for anions, that
may be made in neutral or alkaline solutions, provision is made, in
most systems of analysis, for the removal of such ions by proper
treatment of the substance under examination with sodium carbonate.
Interfering metal ions are thereby converted into carbonates
or hydroxides which are insoluble in water, while the acids
form sodium salts which pass into solution in water. Occasionally,
recourse is also taken to hydrogen sulphide to remove ions of
the arsenic and copper groups.</div>

<p>The treatment with sodium carbonate, while advantageous in
certain cases, is <em class="italic">not uniformly successful</em><a id="FNanchor_590_623" href="#Footnote_590_623" class="fnanchor">590</a>: it is also frequently
complicated by the presence of amphoteric bases or of organic
substances, and frequently demands treatments and tests beyond
those made with the solution thus prepared. Furthermore, if a
group is found to be present, say a group of acid ions forming
barium or calcium salts insoluble in water, but soluble in acids,<a id="FNanchor_591_624" href="#Footnote_591_624" class="fnanchor">591</a>
all the acids of the group, which have not been found to be present
or absent in the analysis for metal ions,<a id="FNanchor_592_625" href="#Footnote_592_625" class="fnanchor">592</a> must be specifically
<a id="p301" class="xxpn">[p301]</a> tested for, <em class="italic">although they may all be absent</em> and the only representative
of the group present may be an ion previously found in the
analysis for metal ions.<a id="FNanchor_593_626" href="#Footnote_593_626" class="fnanchor">593</a> Then, too, when the group is found to
be absent by the group test, more sensitive tests for some of the
acid ions of the group must still be made to insure their complete
absence.<a id="FNanchor_594_627" href="#Footnote_594_627" class="fnanchor">594</a></p>

<p>While much may be said in favor of the systematic analysis for
acid ions, based on the preparation of a solution containing only
the alkali salts of the anions, and <em class="italic">while one should be familiar
with the plan and be able to have recourse to it at will</em>, yet the
drawbacks mentioned suggest another basis for the analysis.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Systematic Analysis for Acid Ions in Acid Solution.</h4>—If the
systematic analysis for acid ions is carried out entirely in <em class="italic">acid
solutions</em>, interference of cations with tests for anions is rarely
met with and in those rare cases may be easily provided against.
Such a method of systematic analysis in acid solution is frequently
more direct and more convenient than a method based on the
removal of cations other than the alkali metal ions. Almost all
of the most characteristic tests for anions, as it is, are carried
out in acid solutions, and only a very few good tests, which must
be made in neutral or alkaline solution, are sacrificed by placing
the emphasis on those carried out in acid solutions. The method,
on the whole, has proved a time-saving and convenient one, without
loss in the trustworthiness of the results.</div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Desirability of Experience with Both Methods.</h4>—It is desirable
to have experience with both methods, and to learn by such
experience, when to have recourse to the one or the other method.
Suggestions as to the choice of method are given in the Laboratory
Manual, p. 119.</div>

<div class="h4p"><h4>The Groups of Acid Ions.</h4>—The arrangement of the acid ions
into groups, for analysis in acid solution, does not differ in any
essential respect from the arrangement based on the use of solutions
of sodium salts of the acid ions—only one group test, which
must be made in neutral solutions, is omitted when the acid solution
is used, and the individual members of this group are tested
<a id="p302" class="xxpn">[p302]</a> for, specifically. As that is also very frequently necessary when
solutions of sodium salts are used, no notable sacrifice in convenience
is made.</div>

<p>Since the grouping for both methods of analysis may be made
the same, the following grouping of acid ions has been adopted.
Only the group characteristics are given; the members of the
groups are described in detail in the Laboratory Manual (Part III).</p>

<p>I. <em class="italic">Ions of Amphoteric Acids and of Related Acids.</em> This group
includes those acids whose amphoteric character, or whose ready
reduction by hydrogen or ammonium sulphide, leads to their
being found, or indicated, in the systematic analysis for metal ions.</p>

<p>II. <em class="italic">The Carbonate Group.</em> This group includes those acids
whose physical properties (insolubility), or the physical properties
of decomposition products of which (carbon dioxide is a
decomposition product of carbonic acid), usually lead to their
discovery in the course of the preparation of solutions or of the
analysis for cations.</p>

<p>III. <em class="italic">The Sulphate Group.</em> The <em class="italic">barium salts</em> of this group of
acid ions are <em class="italic">insoluble in acid solution</em>. Barium nitrate, added
to a solution acidified with nitric acid, is the group reagent.</p>

<p>IV. <em class="italic">The Chloride Group.</em> The anions of this group form <em class="italic">silver
salts</em>, which are <em class="italic">insoluble in nitric acid</em>. Silver nitrate, added to
a solution acidified with nitric acid, is the group reagent.</p>

<p>V. <em class="italic">The Phosphate Group.</em> A test for this group, as a whole,
can be made only if cations other than the alkali metal ions are
absent: the <em class="italic">barium salts</em> of the acid ions of the group are <em class="italic">insoluble
in neutral</em>, but <em class="italic">soluble</em> in strongly <em class="italic">acid, solutions</em>. Barium
nitrate, used with a neutral solution, is the group reagent in the
absence of metal ions other than the alkali metal ions. In the
presence of other cations, the three members of the group, which
are not found in some other group,<a id="FNanchor_595_628" href="#Footnote_595_628" class="fnanchor">595</a> namely: phosphate, borate and
fluoride ions, are tested for specifically, and the group test omitted.
Phosphate-ion is tested for in nitric acid solution, in the same
solution as is used for the tests for groups III and IV. <a id="p303" class="xxpn">[p303]</a></p>

<p>VI. <em class="italic">The Nitrate Group.</em> The salts of the acids of this group are
readily soluble in water and specific tests for the acid ions are
made; there is no group test.</p>

<p>VII. <em class="italic">The Group of Organic Acids.</em> This group need only be
considered when a test for organic matter reveals its presence.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Applications of Physico-Chemical Principles and Theories.</h4>—The
physico-chemical principles and theories, which have been
developed in the previous chapters, naturally apply also to the
reactions by which acid ions are identified. In many cases such
characteristic reactions are identical with reactions studied in
connection with the metal ions. For instance, the precipitation of
silver chloride, used to identify the silver-ion (reagent, chloride-ion),
may be used, with certain precautions, to identify chloride-ion
as well (reagent, silver-ion).</div>

<p>In the following, only a few typical and interesting applications
of the principles and theories to acid ions will be given;
numerous other applications will suggest themselves in connection
with the laboratory work on the acids.</p>

<div class="smalltypeBlk">

<div class="h4p"><h4>Fractional Precipitation of Salts with a Common Ion.</h4> For saturated
solutions of silver chloride, bromide and iodide, we have, according to the
principle of the solubility-product<a id="FNanchor_596_629" href="#Footnote_596_629" class="fnanchor">596</a>:</div>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
<span class="ibnowrap">
[Ag<sup>+</sup>]<sub>1</sub> × [Cl<sup>−</sup>]<sub>1</sub> = K<sub>AgCl</sub> = 1E−10;
<br />
[Ag<sup>+</sup>]<sub>2</sub> × [Br<sup>−</sup>]<sub>2</sub> = K<sub>AgBr</sub> = 4E−13;
<br />
[Ag<sup>+</sup>]<sub>3</sub> × [I<sup>−</sup>]<sub>3</sub> = K<sub>AgI</sub> = 3E−16.
</span></div></div>

<p>For a solution saturated simultaneously with the three silver salts, the value
of the concentration of the silver-ion is the same in the three solubility-products
(see p. <a href="#p164">164</a>). Consequently, for such a solution, with which the three solid
salts are in equilibrium, <em class="italic">the ratios of the concentrations of the anions</em> must be:
[Cl<sup>−</sup>] : [Br<sup>−</sup>] : [I<sup>−</sup>] = K<sub>AgCl</sub> : K<sub>AgBr</sub> : K<sub>AgI</sub> = 3 × 10<sup>5</sup> : 1300 : 1. That is, if
silver nitrate is added to a mixture of iodides, bromides and chlorides, <em class="italic">silver
iodide</em> must be precipitated first, until the concentration of bromide-ion, in
solution, is 1300 times as great as the concentration of the iodide-ion left in
solution. Then <em class="italic">bromide</em> and traces of iodide of silver will be precipitated, <em class="italic">until
the concentration of chloride-ion</em> is 300,000 times as great as the concentration
of iodide-ion and some 250 times as great as the concentration of the bromide-ion.
In other words, if silver nitrate is added gradually to such a mixture,
iodide-ion and bromide-ion will be almost completely removed from solution
<em class="italic">before a precipitate of silver chloride can be in equilibrium</em> with the solution.
This gives us a convenient and rapid method of detecting chlorides, if present,
<a id="p304" class="xxpn">[p304]</a> in more than small quantities, with iodides and bromides. Silver nitrate, a
few drops at a time, is added to the solution and the mixture vigorously shaken
after each addition. As long as a yellow (AgI) or yellowish (AgBr) silver salt
is precipitated on the addition of silver nitrate to the supernatant liquid (the
precipitate settles quickly), silver nitrate is added as before; when the color
becomes quite pale, the solution is filtered and silver nitrate added a drop at
a time; if a <em class="italic">pure white precipitate</em> results finally, chloride-ion is present in the
mixture (<em class="italic">exp.</em>).</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Complex Ions.</h4> Instances of the rôle of complex ions in the analysis for
acid ions are numerous. One of the most interesting illustrations is the
application of the equilibrium conditions for the complex silver-ammonium-ion
(p. <a href="#p224">224</a>) to the separation of silver chloride, bromide and iodide. A rather
more convenient and more sensitive method<a id="FNanchor_597_630" href="#Footnote_597_630" class="fnanchor">597</a> for detecting the three halide
ions in the presence of each other than the method just considered, may be
discussed from this point of view.</div>

<p>The condition of equilibrium between silver-ion, ammonia and silver-ammonium-ion
is expressed in the relation:</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
[Ag<sup>+</sup>] × [NH<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2</sup> / [Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>] = K = 1 / 10<sup>7</sup>.
</div></div>

<p>The concentration of silver-ion, which may exist in an ammoniacal solution,
evidently must decrease rapidly with increasing concentrations of the free
ammonia. Now, let us imagine only sufficient free ammonia, in solution,
added to a mixture of silver chloride, bromide and iodide, to keep the concentration
of silver-ion, which can exist in the solution, say at [Ag<sup>+</sup>] = 6E−9,
which is just 1 / 100th of the concentration of silver-ion in a saturated aqueous
solution of silver bromide. Such a solution of ammonia, in contact with the
three silver salts mentioned, will dissolve silver chloride, if sufficient is present,
until [Cl<sup>−</sup>] = K<sub>AgCl</sub> / 6E−9 = 0.017 molar. At the same time, silver bromide
would be dissolved until [Br<sup>−</sup>] = K<sub>AgBr</sub> / 6E−9 = 0.000,06 molar.
In other words, <em class="italic">silver chloride could be dissolved in some quantity</em>, while silver
bromide is dissolved only in traces (the ratio of [Cl<sup>−</sup>] : [Br<sup>−</sup>] is again about
250 : 1). When such an ammoniacal extract is acidified with nitric acid,
almost pure (white) silver chloride would be precipitated and only traces of
bromide would be lost. After the extraction of the chloride, an <em class="italic">increased
concentration of ammonia</em> would lead, similarly, to a solution in which <em class="italic">silver
bromide would dissolve readily</em> and only traces of the iodide be lost, and thus
a separation of bromide and iodide may be effected.</p>

<p>In Hagar's method, the concentration of ammonia, required to dissolve
silver chloride with but traces of bromide, is attained by the use of a solution
of ammonium sesqui-carbonate,<a id="FNanchor_598_631" href="#Footnote_598_631" class="fnanchor">598</a> in which free ammonia is present only in
small concentration, as a result of the hydrolysis of the salt. After the
<a id="p305" class="xxpn">[p305]</a> extraction of the chloride by this solution, the bromide is extracted with a
5% solution of ammonia.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Complex Ions of Acid Ions with Other Acids.</h4>—In the study of complex
ions we found that positive ions (silver, cupric, etc.) may form complex
positive ions with ammonia<a id="FNanchor_599_632" href="#Footnote_599_632" class="fnanchor">599</a> or complex negative ions with acid ions (<em class="italic">e.g.</em> with
cyanide-ion). In the study of the acid ions we also meet instances of complexes
formed by the <em class="italic">union of two acids</em> to form a new complex acid. Ammonium
phosphomolybdate, an important salt that is extremely useful in detecting the
presence of phosphate-ion, is the most interesting instance of the salt of such
an acid, which is met in elementary qualitative analysis.<a id="FNanchor_600_633" href="#Footnote_600_633" class="fnanchor">600</a></div>

<p>Ammonium phosphomolybdate, (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 12 MoO<sub>3</sub>, is the salt of a
complex phosphomolybdic acid, formed from phosphoric acid, O:P(OH)<sub>3</sub>,
and molybdic acid, O<sub>2</sub>Mo(OH)<sub>2</sub>, by a loss of water, much as potassium dichromate
is formed from potassium acid chromate
[KO(CrO<sub>2</sub>)OH + HO(CrO<sub>2</sub>)OK ⇄ KO(CrO<sub>2</sub>)O(CrO<sub>2</sub>)OK].
The only difference between the two actions
lies in the fact that, in the case of the dichromate, anhydride formation occurs
between two molecules of a single acid; in the case of the phosphomolybdate,
anhydride formation takes place between molecules of different acids, and a
much larger number of molecules is involved. If we suppose the combination
between the two acids to proceed symmetrically,<a id="FNanchor_601_634" href="#Footnote_601_634" class="fnanchor">601</a> we may consider the following
to be the action:</p>

<div class="chemathbox"><div class="equation">
<span class="ibnowrap">
O:P(OH)<sub>3</sub> +
<br />
3 [HO(MoO<sub>2</sub>)OH + HO(MoO<sub>2</sub>)OH + HO(MoO<sub>2</sub>)OH + HO(MoO<sub>2</sub>)OH] ⇄
<br />
O:P[O(MoO<sub>2</sub>)O(MoO<sub>2</sub>)O(MoO<sub>2</sub>)O(MoO<sub>2</sub>)OH]<sub>3</sub> + 12 H<sub>2</sub>O.
</span></div></div>

<p>Intermediate complex acids, containing less molybdic acid, are no doubt
formed first (the action is a relatively slow one), and the action proceeds
until the formation of an insoluble salt leads to the final precipitation of all of
the phosphate in this form. The precipitate shows the characteristic behavior
of an acid anhydride—<em class="italic">alkalies dissolve it readily</em> and form phosphate and
molybdate—<em class="italic">e.g.</em> ammonium hydroxide forms
[NH<sub>4</sub>]<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> and (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>MoO<sub>4</sub>
(<em class="italic">exp.</em>). Dichromates, in a similar way, are converted by alkalies into chromates,
an action which may readily be followed by the change in color (<em class="italic">exp.</em>).</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Oxidation and Reduction.</h4>—While fractional precipitation of silver iodide,
bromide and chloride, and fractional solution of the silver salts in ammonia
are convenient methods for detecting the three halide ions in the presence of
one another, the <em class="italic">most accurate</em> and <em class="italic">most convenient</em> methods for this purpose
depend on the different sensitiveness which iodide, bromide and chloride ions
exhibit towards <em class="italic">oxidizing</em> agents. Of the three halogens, iodine shows the
smallest tendency to form its ion (see the table, p. <a href="#p294">294</a>), chlorine the greatest.
<em class="italic">Vice versa</em>, of the three halide ions, iodide-ion is most readily, chloride-ion least
readily, oxidized. Treatment with a mild oxidizing agent, such as ferric-ion
<a id="p306" class="xxpn">[p306]</a> (see Chap. XIV and Laboratory Manual under iodide-ion), suffices to oxidize
iodide-ion to iodine: 2 Fe<sup>3+</sup> + 2 I<sup>−</sup> ⥂ 2 Fe<sup>2+</sup> + I<sub>2</sub>. Bromide-ion and chloride-ion
are left practically unaffected by this agent (see Chap. XIV). A somewhat
stronger oxidizing agent, chromic acid (or its ion Cr<sup>6+</sup>, see Chap. XV), oxidizes
bromide-ion and leaves chloride-ion practically unaffected:
2 Cr<sup>6+</sup> + 6 Br<sup>−</sup> ⥂ 2 Cr<sup>3+</sup> + 3 Br<sub>2</sub>. This method of fractional oxidation forms one
of the most convenient and sensitive methods for detecting the three halide
ions in the presence of one another.<a id="FNanchor_602_635" href="#Footnote_602_635" class="fnanchor">602</a></div>

<p>We shall discuss here only one other oxidation-reduction reaction, taken
in connection with the laboratory work—the <em class="italic">oxidation of hydroiodic acid by
exposure to the air</em> and the resistance to oxidation shown by an <em class="italic">iodide</em>, such
as potassium iodide, under the same conditions. The following method of
proximate analysis of the chief relations involved may also be used to interpret
the contrast in the behavior of hydroiodic acid and that of hydrobromic or
hydrochloric acid (Laboratory Manual, <em class="italic">q. v.</em>). In all of these cases the actual
relations are rendered more complex in consequence of secondary reactions,
than is indicated in the text that follows: it is intended only to outline the
most effective of the factors involved and to illuminate the qualitative results
observed.</p>

<p>With the aid of this constant and of equation (2) we can obtain,
at least, an approximate interpretation of the results of the
exposure of hydroiodic acid and of potassium iodide to the
influence of atmospheric oxygen.<a id="FNanchor_604_637" href="#Footnote_604_637" class="fnanchor">604</a> We may <a id="p307" class="xxpn">[p307]</a> calculate, first, what

<em class="bold">oxidation</em> of <em class="bold">hydroiodic acid</em>, in molar solution,
by the oxygen of the air, <em class="italic">i.e.</em> to establish equilibrium.
We will call <em class="italic">x</em> that concentration of I<sub>2</sub>. As hydroiodic
acid is a very strong acid, ionized to the extent of about 80%
in molar solution, we may, with sufficient accuracy for our
purpose, consider it completely ionized and put [I<sup>−</sup>] = 1 and
[H<sup>+</sup>] = 1. Since at 25° [H<sup>+</sup>] × [HO<sup>−</sup>] = 1.2E−14 (p. <a href="#p104">104</a>),
we may put [HO<sup>−</sup>] = 10<sup>−14</sup>. The concentration of oxygen in the
air, at room temperature, may be considered to be approximately
[O<sub>2</sub>] = (1/5) × (1 / 23.9). Inserting all these given values in
equation (2), we have</p>

<p class="continue">Solving for <em class="italic">x</em>, we find <em class="italic">x</em> = 10<sup>22</sup> = [I<sub>2</sub>]. That is, free iodine of this enormous
concentration would be required to prevent oxidation of hydroiodic acid in
molar solution by the oxygen of the air at room temperatures. It is obvious
that hydroiodic acid must be extremely sensitive to oxidation by exposure
to air.</p>

<p>One might estimate, in a similar way, the extent to which hydroiodic acid,
of a given concentration, would be oxidized by air before equilibrium would be
reached. The process would involve simultaneous changes in three factors—iodide-ion
is destroyed, iodine is formed and hydroxide-ion increases, as the result
of the neutralization of hydrogen-ion by the hydroxide-ion formed in the
action (see above). The solution of the equilibrium equation is too involved
for the elementary purposes of this discussion: it leads to the same qualitative
conclusion as was just reached.</p>

<div class="h4p"><h4>Oxidation of Potassium Iodide by Air.</h4> We
may now ask what the relations would be, if we used a molar solution
of potassium iodide in place of the free acid. [I<sup>−</sup>]
and [O<sub>2</sub>] would have the same value as before. The
solution being originally neutral, [HO<sup>−</sup>] would at
first have the value √(1.2E−14) = 1.1E−7. But when potassium
iodide is exposed to the air, if iodine is liberated, the solution

class="italic">four</em> HO<sup>−</sup> ions are formed (equation
(1)). If we call <em class="italic">y</em> the concentration of
iodine at the point of equilibrium, then 2 <em class="italic">y</em>
is the concentration of [HO<sup>−</sup>] at that point, formed by the
oxidation process. Inserting the given values<a id="FNanchor_607_640"
href="#Footnote_607_640" class="fnanchor">607</a> in equation (2), we

href="#Footnote_608_641" class="fnanchor">608</a> would be
oxidized (carbonic acid and other acids being excluded); in 5

<p>It is thus clear that the conditions for equilibrium between a
solution of an iodide and air would be satisfied, in the case of an
alkali iodide, by the liberation of a mere trace of iodine, whereas,
as was previously shown, in the case of hydrogen iodide, a very
large proportion of iodine must be liberated before equilibrium
could obtain. A careful comparison of the two developments
shows that the difference in result<a href="#Footnote_610_643"
class="fnanchor">610</a> is plainly due to the higher oxidizing
power, the higher potential of oxygen (p. <a href="#p280">280</a>), in acid solutions,
containing only a minute concentration of hydroxide-ion, as
compared with its efficiency in neutral or slightly alkaline
solution.</p></div>

TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE.

<p>Original printed spelling and grammar is generally retained.
Footnotes were renumbered and relocated to the ends of chapters.
Notes to tables were left in their original locations.
Some mathematical and chemical formulas and equations were
modified in format or rearranged. Original small caps type <em
class="smcap">Looks like This</em>. The transcriber created
the cover image, and hereby releases it to the public
domain.</p>

<p>This book uses many uncommon Unicode characters, and careful
selection of the ebook reader software and font used to view it is
necessary. Some of the uncommon characters not already mentioned are:
U+2296 ⊖, U+2295 ⊕, U+221E ∞, U+221B ∛, U+2212 −, U+21C4 ⇄, U+2192
→, U+21C5 ⇅, U+2572 ╲, and U+2571 ╱, etc. A monospaced
font will improve the appearance of the data tables. However, the
Thin Space U+2009 is used in most of the chemical and mathematical
equations, and an exact monospaced font will not display Thin Space
correctly. Adobe's "Source Code Pro" is an unusual "monospace font"
that does display Thin&#8201;Space and the data tables correctly.</p>

<p>The archaic form of scientific notation exemplified by
"0.0<sub>4</sub>13", is herein simplified either to decimal
form—"0.000013"in this example—or to modern scientific E notation,
"1.3E−5". In this, "E" means "times ten raised to the power of".
Furthermore, E notation has also been substituted herein for many
numbers originally printed like this: "a × 10<sup>b</sup> ".</p>

<p>The name "van't Hoff" was changed to "van&#160;'t Hoff"
throughout; likewise "Van't" to "Van&#160;'t". The hyphen is used
inconsistently throughout the book, in words such as "hydrogen-ion"
versus "hydrogen ion" or "non-ionized" versus "nonionizied". These
have been retained. The word "difficulty" was sometimes employed as
an adverb; herein it is converted to "difficultly" in this usage.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p045">45</a>: Changed "permangante" to
"permanganate".</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p081">81</a>: Removed the unmatched right
parenthesis from "the difference in ionization between potassium
hydroxide and ammonium hydroxide).".</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p104">104</a>: The table notes were reordered and
renumbered to match the sequence of note anchors in the table. The
anchor in the table title originally linked to a footnote instead
of a table note; this footnote was converted to a table note (the
first one).</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p106">106</a>: The label for the sixth note to the
table "The Ionization Constants of Bases" was changed from "3" to
"F".</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p117">117</a>: The chemical reaction schema,
originally comprising two balanced equations and two unbalanced
equations using vertical arrows has been rearranged into four
balanced equations, with horizontal arrows. Such rearrangements have
been silently performed elsewhere.</p>

<p>Page <a id="heavy_arrow"></a><a href="#p117">117</a>: The printed
symbol that might be described as "normal leftward arrow over
rightward dark arrow (or heavy arrow)" has been represented herein
with a more readily available character "⥂"—the Unicode character
with hexadecimal number 2942, designated as "U+2942", rightward
arrow over short leftward arrow. The same character is used herein
for the printed symbol which might be described as "downward dark
arrow left beside upward short arrow right"—the equations having
been rearranged into a horizontal format—and also for "rightward
dark arrow over leftward arrow". A different character U+2943 "⥃"
represents "normal rightward arrow over heavy leftward arrow". <small><a
href="#Footnote_459_482">Rtn to Footnote #459.</a></small> </p>

<p>Page <a href="#p125">125</a>: In the reaction of arsenious
